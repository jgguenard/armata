<div class="message-body">== KNOWN ISSUES ===<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
=== FEATURED ===<br />
* Assigned the NEW new soul icons to all souls.<br />
* The Life saga for Guardians is now available. Go story hunting!<br />
* Have a pile of Soul changes! Your soul points probably got reset in this build.<br />
* We playtest post-launch content on the Alpha and Delta servers from time to time. If you see new zones or instances enabled and disabled here, please note that they are not launch content.<br />
<br />
<br />
GENERAL GAMEPLAY<br />
* Male Dwarves no longer look so... weathered. Current male Dwarf characters will probably appear to have lost a few years off their face somewhere.<br />
* Added a bunch of new emotes! Some hints: Tease, Bonk, Giggle, Tickle, Apologize (as you probably should after using the first four).<br />
* Damage from tar and lava should no longer occur while Soul Walking. It resumes if you re-enter after resurrecting, or when resurrecting still in it.<br />
* We now show up to 4 need/greed loot windows at once instead of one at a time, when multiple drops are waiting.<br />
* Fixed more general issues with people not getting chances to roll on loot appropriately.<br />
* Reduced the default size of nameplates.<br />
* You cannot delete mail with attachments until all attachments have been removed.<br />
* You will no longer be prompted to pay CoD mail charges for each item removed, only once per message.<br />
* To prevent some not-so-nice effects, groups will automatically be set private if any member is inside of an instance.<br />
* Planar currency left in the Rift Loot UI will no longer auto-convert to your currency tab on login before you can retrieve it.<br />
* Dead characters can no longer reveal parts of the map. You'll have to do that while alive!<br />
* When auto-joining the next level bracket channel, you automatically leave the prior one.<br />
<br />
<br />
CULT SAGA<br />
* The Life saga for Guardians is now available. Go story hunting!<br />
* The level 50 component of the Defiant Saga of the Endless is available in Meridian for those who have completed the level 20, 30, and 40 segments.<br />
* The quest On Distant Shores is once again available to allow Kelari players to start down the Saga of the Endless.<br />
* Forces of the Plane of Death: Removed First Battalion Commandant as a required update.<br />
* Kira Thanos has a new and improved model!<br />
* Hooked up rewards to the Defiant Death line.<br />
<br />
<br />
RACIAL ABILITIES<br />
* Kelari Camouflage now looks a bit different, and reduces aggro radius instead of removing it entirely. It also now ends if the character logs out while under its effect.<br />
* Camouflage now stacks with negative polymorph effects like Transmogrify.<br />
* Hibernate: Replaced by Motivational Roar: Increases the movement speed of the Mathosian and nearby group members by 30% for 10 seconds. This ability cannot be used in combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
ASCENDED POWERS<br />
* You should be able to upgrade a quest hub wardstone while PvP auto-flagging is turned off.<br />
* The main planar merchants in Sanctum and Meridian now sell an Ascended Power that lets you summon a Soul Healer for 3 charges.<br />
* Fixed the Invasion summon ability appearing under the General ability page instead of the Ascended Powers tab.<br />
<br />
<br />
GUILD PERKS<br />
* Banners: The following Guild Banners have been removed: Stalwart Banner, Skirmisher´s Banner, Defender´s Banner, Field Medic Banner, Rift Energy Banner, General´s Banner. 6 new banners have been added to replace them.<br />
* Banner of Clairvoyance: Increases maximum Mana by 200/300/400. 3 ranks.<br />
* Banner of Fortitude: Increases maximum Health by 200/300/400. 3 ranks.<br />
* Banner of Zeal: Increases Spell Power by 30/40/50. 3 ranks.<br />
* Banner of Rage: Increases Attack Power by 30/40/50. 3 ranks.<br />
* Banner of Concentration: Increases Spell Focus by 30/40/50. 3 ranks.<br />
* Banner of Precision: Increases Hit rating by 30/40/50. 3 ranks.<br />
* Each of these guild banners last for 3 minutes with an aura radius of 25m. They now require a new Combat Banner Reagent to cast. Only 2 banners can be summoned per player and each raid member can enjoy at most 2 banner effects at any 1 time - so stacking more than 2 banners in close proximity is not a good idea!<br />
* Guild Perk: High Visibility: Increases the radius of your Guild Banners by 10/20/30m.<br />
* Guild Perk: Enduring Banner: Now a 1 point Perk that doubles the duration of your guild banner.<br />

<br />
RIFTS AND INVASIONS<br />
