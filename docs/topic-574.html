<br />
After playing the game for a while over the weekend I realized I was having a hard time seeing things in the grass such as backpacks from killed players and zombies, so I added grass displacement. It's off by default as it has some issues but you can toggle it on by typing<br />
<br />
grass.displacement true in the console (F1)<br />
<br />
It's a work in progress and not everything causes displacement but one of the cool features of it is players leaving a trail where they walk, It's possible to track people for a short time due to this. Also your shelters and campfires will no longer be covered in grass, and backpacks/killed creatures will be easier to spot. Please post any feedback regarding this feature on the forums!<br />
<br />
In addition we've made the following changes and fixes :<br />
<br />
Upgraded to Unity 4.3<br />
Fixed Shelters not counting towards decay grace period<br />
Fixed injury status not disappearing after death<br />
Serverside checks for deployables and structures (no more double dooring)<br />
Some weapon deploy sounds were changed (hatchets no longer sound like guns being drawn)<br />
Hand Cannon no longer requires a workbench to craft<br />
9mm Pistol does slightly more damage and has less recoil<br />
Reduced range on pipe shotgun<br />
Bleeding is no longer a death sentence : Wounds will clot over time so it is possible to survive minor bleeding<br />
Bleeding damage was increased, however...<br />
Silencer now removes tracers as well as muzzle flash, less range reduction, less damage reduction.<br />
Sleeping bags are easier to craft, 15 cloth instead of 20<br />
Pillars take half as many resources to create as they used to<br />
Grenades are larger and their physics should be more reliable, in addition they should deal appropriate damage now<br />
Zombies should now interact with the rocks in the world, and should no longer float in mid-air<br />
Server browser now shows history of servers played on<br />
Server browser is optimized for smaller screens<br />
Server browser doesn't show unresponsive servers<br />
Server browser shows LAN servers<br />
Server browser shows servers containing friends<br />
Server now detects when it has frozen, and closes (allows auto restart scripts to kick in)<br />
No longer uses DX11 mode (was slower, broke alt-tab, had no real benefits)<br />
Added disconnect button<br />
Serverlist can be sorted. Defaults to being ordered by player count descending.<br />
<br />
Known Issues<br />
There is a white development related grid, This will be removed ASAP<br />
Alt tabbing can cause terrible FPS. This is a unity 4.3 issue<br />
Grenades don't damage wildlife</div>
