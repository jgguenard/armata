Update February 6<br />
<br />
As I mentioned in yesterday's update there is a patch tomorrow which has a lot of balancing changes and this is a advanced look at the reasoning behind the changes we've made along with some more patch information:<br />
<br />
There is an increase in vital stats for all roles for the purpose of lessening the hitpoint differences between them. This also serves to reduce the cost of using special abilities.<br />
<br />
There have also been changes to reduce the effectiveness of bow-wielding Warriors and Elementalists which are deemed too effective in their current state.<br />
<br />
Elementalists will see a boost to Attunement to Fire, introducing a casting time bonus buff and balancing its' duration and cooldown. Another change that impacts the survivability of Elementalists is the reduction in magic protections of the armors of Warriors and Skirmishers, as well as the increase in piercing protection of the Elementalist robes. The latter change will apply to new and existing armor pieces. There are also changes to Staff bolt, increasing its' mana cost and reducing its area of effect, but also increasing its speed, making it used more as a bolt, as was intended.<br />
<br />
A new feature that is being introduced to the beta is Stats on Kill. Players will now gain vital stats (health, mana, stamina) when killing other players during PvP, giving the opportunity to smaller and more skilled teams to outplay larger ones.<br />
<br />
A number of changes have been made in digging and the amount of materials acquired after each successful dig has been greatly increased. Another change in digging is that the minimum digging distance has been reduced. This makes digging more meaningful while also directly affecting cooking and its' progress.<br />
<br />
We have also fixed a large number of bugs, with a notable fixes of not being able to skill up on a mount anymore, fixing the exploit where you can use a mount to get into the geometry, the reset of the &quot;Summon Friend&quot; cooldown when relogging, and the ones which cause monsters to become unresponsive.<br />
<br />
And a clarification on yesterday's update: the Primalist will be in before release.<br />
<br />
Full patch notes will be posted tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.<br />

This is another big issue many of us are wondering about, would like some info about it. Not necessarily an eta but overall development progression.<br />
<br />
And btw, thanks for the update</blockquote>
