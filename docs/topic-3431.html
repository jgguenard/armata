<br />
Zilas is a unique fight that depends mostly on execution and raid DPS. While it isn't overly complex in strategy, it is still a fairly difficult fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Difficulty level: 7 (medium)<br />
Health: 6.8m<br />
Hard enrage timer: Unknown, though mostly irrelevant<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2 tanks<br />
3 healers (1 single target healer, 2 AoE healers)<br />
2 support (1 bard, 1 archon)<br />
13 DPS (at least 2 ranged -- preferably with interrupts, but not required)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The most important part of Zilas' encounter is understanding each of the different types of adds he spawns, and having enough raid DPS to deal with them. The different adds include:<br />
<br />
Escaped Butcher, 125k HP - Reduces the raid's damage output by 10% for every active Butcher<br />
Escaped Imp, 62k HP - Attempts to heal the boss by casting Cede Spirit (interruptable)<br />
Drifting Spirit, 19k HP - Attacks from ranged, and will begin AoE'ing the raid with Dark Volley if not killed quick enough and not interrupted<br />
Escaped Magus, 200k HP - Will wipe the entire raid if allowed to make it to the middle of the room and given 5 seconds to cast Purge the Living<br />
Wrathful Bones, 28k HP - Spawns in large quantities after every &quot;kite phase&quot; (explained later), non-threatening as long as picked up by a tank<br />
<br />
Start by placing your entire raid in the middle of room, while facing the boss towards the entrance and having everyone else stack up behind him. The boss has a cleave effect (but none of the adds can cleave), and there is no need for people to spread out at all.<br />
<br />
The adds will all spawn towards the entrance of the room, and slowly walk around the outside of the room until they eventually reach the middle.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.riftstrats.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/zilastd.jpg" alt="zilastd.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br />
<br />
From 100% to 60%, the boss will only spawn Butchers, Imps, and Spirits. The Spirits will stop half-way through and begin casting on the raid from range. You should have one ranged DPS assigned to each side, and these spirits will always be their top priority for the entire fight. If they are not killed quick enough they will begin AoE'ing the raid with Dark Volley (which can be interrupted); it is acceptable for them to get some casts off though as the damage is healable.<br />
<br />
The Butchers and Imps should be allowed to reach the middle area so that they may be cleaved and AoE'd down on top of the boss. Be sure to assign one interrupter for the Imps, which will always be that person's top priority as well. They should be looking for a spell called Cede Spirit, which has around a 5 second cast time and will heal the boss for 5% if it goes off. A backup interrupter should be assigned as well, but it is pretty rare to have two Imps up at once. Butchers and Imps do not need to be focused down with single-target damage, just be sure to kill them with AoE damage while still working on the boss.<br />
<br />
The fight is fairly easy and straight forward until 60%. At that point, the boss will enter a new phase and begin summoning Escaped Magi. The first Escaped Magus will usually reach the half-way point (where the Spirits stop) about 30 seconds after the boss reaches 60%. All DPS that do not have a higher priority responsibility should jump up the stairs and begin attacking the Magus as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Escaped Magi can be stunned by simply attacking the Stasis Crystal when it is next to it. And you can actually double stun it, as seen below:<br />
<br />
<br />
(click for larger view)<br />
<br />
When the crystal is glowing red it means it is available to be used, when it is glowing green it means the mob is currently stunned, and when it is glowing yellow it means it is currently recharging.<br />
<br />
The most difficult part of the fight now comes in determining how long you have to work on the Magi until the boss begins his kite phase. You will have approximately 15 seconds to work on the first add before your entire raid needs to collapse in the middle. You should be able to get the Magus below half health before this happens hopefully, and try to have someone with an instant cast ranged spell stun it a second time as you're running back to the middle. Do not chase the first add beyond the crystal point.<br />
<br />
The kite phase is signified by a raid emote that says, &quot;Soulrender Zilas surges with the power of Death!&quot; When this happens, you have approximately 8 seconds to get into position, so do not panic when you first see it.<br />
<br />
The boss will channel a beam of death in a clockwise fashion, similar to the last boss in expert CC. If it passes through you it will instantly kill you, but you are given ample warning time to determine where it is going to be positioned.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The white wisp rotating around the room warns you where he will be casting it. Since you have plenty of time before he actually begins channeling the deadly portion of his spell, simply hold still and let the wisp pass through your character once, and then chase it. If done properly, it is incredibly easy to avoid.<br />
<br />
The boss will begin casting the &quot;wind up&quot; portion of Soulrender's Grasp about 3 seconds after the raid emote. This cast is about 5 seconds and is just a warning, and he won't begin channeling the beam until it finishes. After it finishes, he will have around a 10 second channel where the whole raid needs to kite around the middle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Notice the purple circle located directly in the middle: this is deadly as well. Simply chase the beam around in a clockwise fashion while hugging the edge of the purple circle. The entire raid must be on the boss' main platform as well, or they will be insta-killed (even if it looks like they're out of the beam's range).<br />
<br />
From here on out it is mostly a matter of mastering the kite phase while managing to keep the Magi under control. The kite phases are approximately 60 seconds apart. This means that whenever a kite phase ends, all of your DPS are free to leave the middle area and chase down any Magi that are up. If you only got a Magus to 50% before having to kite, as soon as it ends you should run to intercept it (before it reaches the middle). You may also have time to jump on the next Magus that spawns early, and chase it until it dies.<br />
<br />
When a kite phase is due to happen again (it may take you a few attempts to get a good feel for this), you need to be sure that no one is further away than any of the Stasis Crystals. If someone is in the corner of the room when the kite phase warning appears, they will not have enough time to make it back to the middle. Expect numerous wipes as your raid simply adjusts to and learns the time on this. Eventually though, you should have zero deaths to the kite phase, and never be letting a Magus reach the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
And just when you master the kite phase and Magi, the encounter will throw you another curve ball. At 20%, Zilas will begin deactivating certain Stasis Crystals, as signified by a purple-death-looking animation on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means you can no longer stun the Magi, and also makes the fight heavily RNG-dependent. The worst-case-scenario when this happens, would be for a Magus to pass by the middle area during a kite phase. If this happens, it is very unlikely you will be able to kill the Magus in time after the kite phase ends. However, you should only have to deal with 1 Magus during this phase if your raid DPS is high enough.<br />
<br />
Once the boss is at around 7%, any Magi that have not already reached a Stasis Crystal should be completely ignored. At this point it just becomes a burn, and you should have most of your raid-wide DPS cooldowns saved for this (or helping you kill a Magus before that). Be sure to not let the Escaped Butchers stack up too much in advance of this burn phase (since they reduce your damage output), but once the boss is 7% you should focus solely on single-target damaging the boss. Also be sure that the Imps continue to be interrupted; having them get off a 5% heal during this phase would be devastating.<br />
<br />
It may seem logical to try and clean up the adds before pushing the boss to 20%, but I would usually recommend against this, simply due to the fact that there is a constant stream of adds and it serves no real purpose. It would be ideal to push the boss to 20% directly following a kite phase, but again, I would not recommend actually stalling DPS to try and do this.<br />
<br />
The RNG component comes primarily from when your raid happens to push the boss to 20% (if it's right before a kite phase), and when the Magi spawn compared to when the kite phases happen. As long as the boss is above 7%, whenever a kite phase finishes you should have all DPS splitting off and chasing down any Magi that are up, whether they just spawned or are nearing the boss' platform.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Demonic Presence - Reduces damage output by 10% per stack, one stack for every active Escaped Butcher<br />
Cede Spirit - 5% boss heal cast by Escaped Imps (interruptable)<br />
Dark Volley - Raid-wide AoE damage cast by Drifting Spirits (interruptable)<br />
Purge the Living - Full raid wipe if Escaped Magus allowed to make it to boss platform and cast for 5 seconds (un-interruptable)<br />
Soulrender's Grasp - Clockwise death beam that needs to be kited, 5 second wind-up time, 10 second channel<br />
Soulrender's Rage - Full raid wipe if boss is not properly tanked</div>

<br />
Soulrender Zilas is the first boss in the west wing of Hammerknell. This is somewhat of an advanced tower defense encounter. Adds spawn and follow 1 of 4 paths to get to the boss. Along the paths are Stasis Crystals, 1 for each path, these can be activated to stun any enemy within their range for a short time.<br />
<br />
Zilas hits for physical damage and not that hard. You can read more about the tanking on Ciderhelm´s website here. He does have a frontal cleave, so anyone not the tank will want to avoid his immediate frontside at all times.<br />
<br />
There are 5 total types of adds, the Â“EscapedÂ” adds come in from the add spawn point at the entrance of the room. The ghosts and spirits come in from the opposite side and move very quickly to one of the sides.<br />
<br />
<br />
Escaped Imps: Deal minor melee damage, heals the boss. The heal can, and must be interrupted<br />
<br />
Escaped Butchers:  Cleaves, watch out! Applies a debuff to the entire raid that reduces damage output by 10%, will stack if multiple Butchers are alive.<br />
<br />
Escaped Magus: These walk slowly around the path, once they reach the boss area they begin a 8 second cast that kills the entire raid. The only way to interrupt it is by killing them.<br />
<br />
White ghosts: I forget their real name, they are obvious though. They run in from the rear of the room and begin casting Void Bolts. After about 4 Void Bolts they cast a Void Barrage which hits 5-6 members of the raid for massive AoE. Ideally kill these before they get off the barrages, but at least kill them before 2 or more are alive. They have 19k health.<br />
<br />
Umbral Spirits: Only spawn in the last 20%, they quickly run up to a Stasis Crystal and disable it. The Crystal the disable is always on a path that a Magus has spawned.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://bluedots.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/zilas.png" alt="zilas.png" class="bbcode_img" /><br />
<br />
At 60% Zilas will periodically Â“Surge with the power of deathÂ” and begin casting Â“Soulrender´s GraspÂ”. While he is casting a white whisp appears and begins circling the inner circle, clockwise. As soon as Zilas finishes the cast a purple beam connects Zilas to the circling whisp. Anyone touched by the beam, outside the circle, or within melee range of the boss will immediately die. The beam will go around the room one entire rotation, plus an additional 30 degrees or so. The whisp will rotate the room 1 entire rotation before the purple beam appears.<br />
Think of the room as a giant clock:<br />
<img src="http://bluedots.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/zilasclock-300x300.png" alt="zilasclock-300x300.png" class="bbcode_img" /><br />
<br />
When the emote appears look for the whisp. If the whisp starts at 2 o´clock you can stand at 12 o´clock. Once the beam starts you can run to 4 o´clock and then ignore it.<br />
<br />
<br />
For our kill we had 2 tanks, one on Zilas full time, and the other on adds full time. We had 3 DPS in the middle who were responsible for keeping the Imps interrupted and dealing massive AoE  damage to the boss and adds. We had an Archon, Chloromancer, and 2 Cleric healers who stayed in the middle full time. We had 3 DPS mages (any ranged will do) who were responsible for killing the White ghosts and Umbral spirits, and activating the Stasis Crystals. Everyone else, including the Bard for run speed, were floating around the room to kill Magus.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Imps and Butchered we allowed to get into the middle. It was best to do 0 damage to them on the paths as they can still build threat even though they won´t attack you until they reach the center. Once in the center they were grouped, interrupted, and AoEd.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Stasis Crystals were activated by hitting them with a single direct damage spell or ability. As far as we could tell, AoE and Auto Attacks did not activate them. The mages used 31/35 Necro/Lock with a 0 point in Dominator for Neural Prod. Neural Prod is instant, has no cooldown and most importantly, no travel time.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the mages timed it right and stunned the Magus when they first stepped onto the stun area they could stun them again before they got off the stun area, essentially doubling the time they are stunned.<br />
The Magus were our biggest, or longest lasting problem. Typically the first Magus was easy, but the second Magus and then every other Magus after that would reach the stun area right after the purple beam of death started.<br />
<br />
<br />
What worked best for us was to follow a timeline sort of like this:<br />
<br />
First 40%, smooth and easy. Mages kill ghosts, everyone kills boss.<br />
Sub 60%, Magus 1 spawns. It is killed in the stun area.<br />
Magus 2 spawns, is ignored.<br />
Purple beam of death 1<br />
As soon as the Purple beam is over the floating group ran across the bridge and met Magus 2<br />
Magus 3 spawns<br />
Magus 2 dies<br />
Magus 3 is stunned and killed in stun area<br />
Magus 4 spawns<br />
Beam of death 2<br />
Floaters run across bridge and kill Magus 4 as Magus 5 spawns.<br />
Magus 5 is killed in stun area.<br />
And so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
This timing never worked out perfectly. The paths are different lengths and where they spawn is random. Sometimes we could kill 2 in the stun area, other times we had to kill both as they crossed the bridge and began casting their insta wipe.<br />
<br />
Our most common deaths were to the purple beam. Make sure everyone understands exactly how it works. You waste a lot of time by running further then you need to. People also died because lag showed the beam in a slightly different location then where it was, give it a wide berth.<br />
<br />
As the adds came into the center it was common for a tank to be unable to pick it up before it got a hit off on someone. If the hit crit it could one shot a healer.<br />
<br />
Letting multiple white ghosts get their barrage off simultaneously, or during the purple beam, was almost always a few deaths. Make sure your healers know that a barrage might get off if a ghost is alive during a beam.</div>

<div class="message-body">2 Spirits shouldn't be up at the same time. Also, Magus DPS should not be affected by Spirits. If that is the case then you have poor Spirit assignments.<br />
<br />
The Magus in the laser phase needs to be stunned as a major, major priority. Acing the stuns is critical to controlling the RNG in the fight. If you fail, then you fail.<br />
<br />
<br />
What this comes down to is poor management. You are over-allocating DPS to kill Maguses. $10 says you have your entire DPS switch to it. Bad idea. You lose a lot of DPS switching, especially when Spirits and Maguses spawn on opposite sides. You need to have more reliable DPS overall that are less sensitive to target switches. You also need to minimize the number of people you explicitly assign to things like Spirits, while getting them down reliably. If you get hit by a Dark Volley, you have failed.<br />
<br />
At worst, we've been nailed by like 5 Maguses in a row mid-fight -- literally in a row. Bottom line is you just deal with it. With that nasty of an RNG roll, you may not drop Zilas' HP by very much during that span of time. However, that doesn't matter. Just survive that sequence then continue the fight. Not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Not sure if you've played a lot of Tower Defense maps in RTS games, but one key thing is to judge your DPS appropriately. When you burst a Magus that is walking away from the stun pad, when he gets to something reasonably low, get off. Get back to the center and hit Zilas, or hit the next Magus. The last 20% of the Magus' HP will be eaten by DOTs (down to 15-10%), and then it can be finished with barely any effort on the main platform.<br />
<br />
The entire fight is about strategizing and adapting to avoid lost / wasted DPS. The Magus mechanic is a huge bait to waste DPS, over and over again.</div>

1 tank, le monde stack sul side, le marksman ye popire pareil[hr]<br />
An FYI for the &quot;exploding&quot; adds that spawn with the skeletons after each laser sub 20%: They do NOT do the AOE when they die. They cast an ability called Dying Grasp or Dying Gasp, not sure which is actually right. It is interruptable. We had 2 people assigned to focus them down and we didn't take any AOE damage from it.</div>
