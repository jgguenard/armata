<div class="message-body">I'm honestly really disappointed at how imbalanced the game currently is.<br />
<br />
A couple of weeks ago, I felt the game was balanced perfectly in my opinion. With a mixture of T1 and T2 expert gear, my mage was comfortably doing around 1k dps in Single Target fights and between 2k-3k dps in AE fights. I was doing this amount of dps along other DPS souls from other Callings and we were having fun at pointing out who was doing the most DPS after every encounter. No one was too far ahead and no one was too far behind (excluding tanks and healers of course). Of course, I recognize that i was able to do this amount of DPS with the legendary 28 Stormcaller / 38 Elementalist role, since this was the only spec in the Mage calling that was able to do that amount of DPS (every other Mage spec was in dire need of a buff).<br />
<br />
After the Melee crit nerf and the Shaman nerf that was released a couple of weeks ago in a patch, Storm/Elem build was now the king of DPS as far as I could tell. I kept doing 1k-3k dps on my parser while everyone else's DPS succumbed to that terrible nerf. This was a sign of terrible things to come.<br />
<br />
Now after 01/28/2011's patch, everything went to hell. Our 28Storm/38Elem spec was nerfed, basicly cutting our DPS in half, literally. Now I'm doing around 450-500 dps as 32Storm/34Elem. Now, supposedly Necro's and Pyro's were buffed, but after testing them both their DPS went up just a little bit to hit that 450-500 dps mark with a mix of T1-T2 expert gear. I guess you can say the spec's are somewhat &quot;balanced&quot; for the mage calling in particular... but here's the thing that's troubling me: Rogues and Warriors are now doing a lot more DPS than Mages are in more or less the same gear.<br />
<br />
I'm looking at Rogues in T2 gear do between 750-900 dps and Warriors with T1 and/or T2 do 800-900 dps after today's patch according to my Parser.<br />
<br />
Now, hear me out on this, I do not wish for Rogues or Warriors to get nerfed. As I expressed in the beginning, before Melee Crit nerf and before Shamans got nerfed... That time where every calling in particular were able to compete against other callings with their best DPS spec and have fun while doing that.. Now that's what I would like to see again. I would like to see the game balanced as it was before. The only thing that it needed was to buff those DPS Souls that were doing substantially less DPS than the others.<br />
<br />
If what you want is for all Souls to do around 500 DPS more or less with T2 gear, then I implore you to do just that; but currently the best DPS specs from the Rogues and the Warriors are out dpsing us Mages with our best DPS specs. I don't enjoy that whatsoever, and as a person that likes to compete with others in the damage meters... If this is something that doesn't change before the game goes live, then I will have no other choice than to reroll to the Calling that does the most DPS. I truly wish that it doesn't have to go like that because I've always enjoyed playing a Mage class in all the MMO's i've played, but I don't like to feel like I'm useless. With Archons still bugged when there's a Bard in the group/raid and Dominators being useless outside of PvP, there's not much else for us mages to currently do other than go Chloro or be subpar DPS.<br />
<br />
Please balance the game to what it once was. </div>
