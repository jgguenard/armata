<br />
Raid Damage: Very high throughout the whole fight. Slightly lower during the air phase.<br />
<br />
Strategy:<br />
The fight begins with Tank#1 picking Alsbeth up. Tank #2 and #3 will pickup the 3 Fallen Guardians/Defiants that spawn. They will tank them behind Alsbeth facing away from the raid. The raid will begin Aoe´ing all adds and Alsbeth at this point. When the adds have died, all DPS will switch to Alsbeth.<br />
<br />
Every ~40 seconds, Alsbeth will become immune, and fly into the air. At this point a Soul Harbinger, Soul Thief, or Soul Magus will spawn. She spawns varying amounts of adds each air phase. The pattern is:<br />
1st phase: 1 random, and 1 Discordant Pillar<br />
2nd phase: 2 random, and 2 Discordant Pillars<br />
3rd phase: 1 of each, and 3 Discordant Pillars<br />
<br />
She will also spawn 6 Discordant Energies. During the first 2 air phases, it is Tank #2 and #3´s responsibility to pickup the adds/discordant energies. During the 3rd+ air phase, Tank #1 will assist in picking up one add, with his always being the primary DPS target.<br />
<br />
She also begins to use Discordant Meteor on one random raid member. When she emotes, and marks that player, all nearby raid members must stack on that person to disperse the damage evenly amongst them.<br />
<br />
Whenever a Soul Magus is spawned, there must be at least 2 interrupters assigned to it. The spell they need to interrupt is Soul Destruction.<br />
<br />
After the adds have been killed, Crystals will start spawning at the Galvanic Focus´ towards the edge of the arena. These must be collected and run to the beams that are shielding the Discordant Pillars. When the shield goes down, the raid will destroy the Pillar. When all pillars have been destroyed, Alsbeth will land.<br />
<br />
After the Soul adds are killed during the air phase, Alsbeth will begin to spawn Fallen Defiants/Guardians in groups of 3. Tank #2 and #3 should be picking these up and dragging them to the center to be AoE´d down along with the Discordant Energies.<br />
<br />
When Alsbeth lands, she will spawn 3 Fallen Defiants/Guardians.<br />
<br />
There may be a point that the tank needs to temporarily swap to allow his Grave Bolt Debuff stacks to fall off. A rogue tank is also able to knock the stacks off by waiting until she lands, casts a Chains of Discord, then casts Punish Soul, and uses Scatter the Shadows to immunity the Grave Bolt she uses immediately afterwards.<br />
<br />
At this point the fight is rinse/repeat until 20%.<br />
<br />
At 20% Alsbeth RP´s a bit and then heals to 100% health. She will gain a incoming damage reflection shield and spawn ~10 Discordant Energies. She will continue using all ground abilities at this point with the addition of Discordant Ground. When she has her shield up, DPS must be AoE´ing Discordant Energy so they do not get overrun.<br />
<br />
Crystals will also be spawning at the outskirts of the map at this point in time. All DPS should be picking these up and running them into Alsbeth. Each crystal they run into her does 7% of her health in damage.<br />
<br />
She will continue to spawn ~10 Discordant Energies until she dies.<br />
<br />
