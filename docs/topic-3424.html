Reflect command and reflect presence are overpowerd for this fight and will get nerfed. If you are getting more than 1 shrine phase your dps is lacking. You can reflect his &quot;fist&quot; skill for 35k each, and also reflect his normal attacks. Also if you have two mages you can pretty much have a blank of reflective presence during phase 3 which is about 20 seconds of &quot;ALMOST&quot; pure immunity. Use it before it gets fix IMO =]<br />
<br />
With a warrior Tank at Phase 3 it should be hard. But you can use the new Speed Potions. 50% faster run about 10sec - without Cooldown. This Potion can also avoid deaths in the first two Phases.<br />
<br />
Also in Phase 3 the epic Raid-Heal Potions will be very helpful. Keep going on! Uruluuk is hard, but in my opinion in a very good balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
, we donÂ´t run earth resist, we run a Archont who is able to reduce the damage and the guild resistance ability (donÂ´t know the english name) with 2 points spent on it. You can see this on the beginning of my video (1:00min), i buffed it during the fight as i realized it was forgotten. And everyone, except the healers, had some of the great epic raidheal potions. Every thing that can buff the raid endurance, sink down the raid damage and heal the raid will be great in Phase 3. Also the flames out of the Rifts should be great, but we havenÂ´t test it yet.<br />
<br />

<br />
I tanked this just fine as a warrior in the same spec that I use for Alsbeth to Greenscale (vk/pal/reav). Tanking is probably the easiest part of this fight.<br />
<br />
The only real issue with this fight for us was the raid damage the last 30%. Once we had people boost their survivabllity and spread / collapse we downed him np.<br />
<br />
<br />
We downed him tonight ...<br />
<br />
1 Tank - Warrior<br />
2 Heals - Chloro / Cleric<br />
1 Bard<br />
1 Arch<br />
1 Support Cleric (Melee)<br />
4 DPS (2 War, 2 Rog)<br />
<br />
the fight ends after 7min25sec<br />
<br />
Try to get him under 30% in 1 shrine/crystal phase ...<br />
with 3 stacks his dmg is just &quot;low&quot; ...<br />
Spellreflect these &quot;Fist of Laethys&quot; our tank did round about 270k dmg on this fight<br />
<br />
under 30% the adds were being tanked while everyone else focused the boss<br />
<br />
Seems spellreflect is the op skill in this fight which makes this boss a lot easier<br />
<br />
We dont even noticed a dmg buff from the buff<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
whats the spell do you guys use for reflecting the fist<br />
Our Chloro did it. He used the 6 points spell &quot;Reflective Command&quot; of the Dominator soul i guess.<br />
<br />
There is really a lot of moving parts to this mob but once you get in sync you'll be surprised how quick he dies. This might not work for everyone but what we did was -<br />
<br />
1) Survive as someone posted. Go respec, use endurance gear, use pots, mathos vendor food, and anything else you can to boost your survivability. Our mages and clerics were above 6k hp's as well.<br />
<br />
2) The last 30% you should pre-assign spots for people to dps / heal / whatever from. Just have people be ready to collapse for storm. By spreading out you are negating the splash dmg from explosive crystal. Whoever posted it hits the farthest person is spreading bad info. Spread out for explosive + Collapse = win.<br />
<br />
3) I tanked the skels at the base of the stairs near the podium. Tanks will notice after the initial pop the have a pattern which is north, south, north, south etc. Face west and pay attention as they spawn they rush the raid and need to be picked up instantly.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps those having issues<br />

<div class="message-body">We killed him roughly 7 minutes (one shrine phase). You can see the parse in these screenshots:<br />

I gotta admit, you can see from the parses, we completely cheesed it. We used chloro and archon both having reflective presences and on top of that they both had charge potions to increase the duration of the presence significantly up to a point where the uptime was 95%. We probably could have done it normal way, but just couldn't resist clever use of game mechanics. Anyway, in the parses I play Baltman, rogue tank, and you can see with the usage of presences I was able to go up to almost 1k dps. Actually I was on 1.4k, but because of the last phase it dropped.[hr]<br />
Heh. We just were reflecting the Fist but it makes sense to keep presence up for his normal attacks. (Although those are super easy to heal through). But I agree, was fun seeing myself near top DPS as a tank.<br />
<br />
Oh how amazing it would be if that could be possible on non reflect fights </div>

<div class="message-body">What we are doing is just the normal routine of DPS boss, DPS crystal, move close and so fourth. Move up to the stairs when he ports and burn him in his vulnerable face. When the 3 crystal things spawn, we DPS them all down going for the unpurgable one first. If your dps is right, you shouldn't have to move close to him before the 3rd one is down.<br />
<br />
When he hits 30% everyone moves up to him with your cleric and chloro standing at each side of the stairs right in the middle to avoid explosive crystal ae damage.<br />
<br />
1 aoe dps kills the first bunch of adds while everyone else just dps's the boss down.<br />
<br />
When i did it the first time, our chloro died in the last 30% so we only had 1 warden/sentinel healing and a bard. So if you just position yourself its a piece of piss and not overtuned at all.[hr]<br />
Granted it depends who is available, but we try to make the healing as easy as possible.<br />
<br />
2 War/Sents<br />
1 Shamicar (focuses AOE Healing and Add DPS)<br />
1 Bard<br />
1 Archon/Dom thing. I think. Or chloro dom? Not entirely sure tbh. But having the Doctrines make things super easy that last phase. Do Any of your clerics have that?<br />
<br />
The 50% Kind of works for casters. We kill the shrines when they are up though and don't worry about it to much otherwise anymore. Reflect is enough DPS for us to never have a second shrine phase.[hr]<br />
Try having one of the DPS go Shamicar. Long as you are using Reflect the DPS requirements are pretty small for the fight actually, having the extra healing is much more important sub 30%.</div>
