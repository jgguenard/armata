<blockquote>
<cite>Quote:</cite>
Updated based on conversations at the last Alliance Leadership Meeting.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Titan Alliance has a vision of ensuring victory in World vs. World and leading a robust and productive community on whichever server we land.<br />
<br />
Our goal is simple: to be the top ranked server for World vs. World in Guild Wars 2.<br />
<br />
The guilds of TA share the following core values, and prospective member guilds are only brought into the Alliance if there is a strong feeling that they would embody these values as well:<br />
<br />
Â• Team. As an alliance we hold each guild in mutual respect and treat each member as if they were members of each other´s guilds. Above all else, we hold our shared vision as paramount, and each guild works to ensure that our members are working towards ensuring our goals are met. As such, we have a strict non-poaching policy in terms of our members, and collaborate in member recruitment efforts. When calls to arms are issued, every member of each guild participates.<br />
<br />
Â• Unlike other major MMO alliances, every guild within the Titan Alliance has an equal voice and does not follow in the shadow of any particular guild or leader. In a case where there is not a consensus on a decision, which is rare given the shared philosophies and playstyles of our member guilds, decisions are reached by a one-vote-per-guild basis. All forms of recognition in the community and in-game are shared Â– from keep claiming within the game, to the video production of victories afterwards.<br />
<br />
Â• Organization and Strategy. We believe that what separates a mindless zerg from a coordinated legion is the degree of organization, forethought, and strategy before the battle and in the field. The leadership teams of member guilds are in constant communication, hold weekly meetings to coordinate tactics, and run cross-guild training sessions to support the skill-development of all members.<br />
<br />
Â• Community. We believe that community is at the heart of any successful MMO, and each member of the Titan Alliance holds this in high regard. We do not belittle other guilds, alliances, or servers, or talk trash against our competition Â– aside from posting videos of our victories - and expect the same from our members. The guilds of the Alliance have a strict ethical standard Â– we do not condone any below-the-belt tactics including exploiting and spying. In addition, we will be providing open TeamSpeak channels for PUG groups on our server, alongside training sessions and tutorials for players on our server who are interested in developing Â– and teaching Â– their skills.<br />
<br />
Requirements for Membership the Alliance:<br />
<br />
The following is looked for in all applicant guilds to the Alliance before a trial is granted, and must be maintained by all member guilds for continued membership:<br />
<br />
Â• Consistent adherence to the charter and the core values.<br />
<br />
Â• High level of communication. Guilds are expected to be in constant communication with the rest of the alliance, via our forums, voice communication, and attendance at our weekly meetings.<br />
<br />
Â• <b>A hardcore playstyle and a high level of organization. Guilds are expected to have detailed strategies and organization and commit to a hardcore play-schedule, with WvW being the primary focus, multiple days a week.</b><br />
<br />
Â• <b>Presence. <u>Guilds must be able to field a bare minimum of 20 members during their prime time consistently in WvW</u>. </b><b><u>In addition, all guilds must agree to emergency</u> Â“<u>All Calls</u>Â” <u>where when an alliance guild requests support</u>, <u>all members of alliance guilds online and not in the midst of an sPVP tournament Â– regardless of whether it is their primetime or guild scheduled event time</u> Â– join the fight.</b><br />
<br />
Â• <b>Representation consistent with our core value of Community. All guilds must monitor their members´ participation in public forums, in game and in the community, and immediately deal with any trolling or negative behavior.</b><br />
<br />
Application Process:<br />
<br />
Â• Guilds who are interested in joining the Alliance must make a post on our public forums or email titanalliance (at) Hotmail (dot) com. Guilds that meet our requirements meet with one of the alliance guilds for an initial exploratory conversation, and if all goes well are brought to the next Alliance meeting to present their guild. After the presentation, the guild is voted on whether or not the Alliance will grant Â“Trial Status.Â”<br />
<br />
Â• Trial Status. Guilds that are voted for a Trial will be given a three-day period once the game has launched where they will be assessed by the Alliance to ensure they are the right fit, and can demonstrate adherence to this charter. After three days a vote is taken on whether to make them official members of the Alliance. Due to the fact that we respect all member guilds who contribute on the battlefield, Trial Guilds are permitted to advertise their guild as a member of the Titan Alliance and will be featured in our videos and on our webpage even during their trial status.</blockquote>
