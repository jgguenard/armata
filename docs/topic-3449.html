<div class="message-body">&quot;Winds of Chaos&quot; Feedback.<br />
We ran this raid twice in about 2 hours, really easy, but still disappointed with no loot !<br />
<br />
Raid Composition:<br />
1 Reaver (26) / Paladin (27) / Warlord (13)<br />
1 Sentinel (28)/ Purifier (6) / Warden (32)<br />
1 Warden (51) / Sentinel (15)<br />
1 Bard (51) / Sab (5) / Marksman (10)<br />
1 Elementalist (34) / Stormcaller (32)<br />
1 Marksman (38) /Assassin (17 )/Nightblade (11)<br />
1 Marksman (AFK at the moment, will get build soon)<br />
1 Riftblade (32) / Paragon (26) /Champion (8)<br />
1 Shaman (51) / Druid (15) / Justicar (5)<br />
1 Warrior DPS (Pug)<br />
1 Cleric Support (Pug)<br />
<br />
Phase 1 - The Nexus<br />
The first phase looked pretty sweet, expecting high AoE damage from both the lightning, the nexus nuking people, and the birds doing a type of stormy AoE? But we was pretty disappointed when we ran into combat. We pulled the two birds and ran out of range of the nexus making it a VERY easy kill. The two birds went down and we went in cautious of the lightning strikes on the floor, after about 20 seconds of pure nuking on the nexus, we realised the lightning on the floor did around 400 damage per second to anyone standing in it, and it changed rotation every 6/7 seconds, very easily outhealable. Disappointed with the Phase 1, was very very easy with hardly any damage output, just a long boring fight.<br />
<br />
Phase 2 - Storm Elementals<br />
Two swirling storm elements appeared, expecting atleast some damage output here. Tank ran in and grabbed the first elemental, was average damage on the tank, but easily outhealable with two healers, grabbed both the elementals, and then realised a storm cloud appeared over a bunched up group of raiders, high AoE damage on the group (which we liked) but was still outhealable, move straight out the clouds, and repeat. Maybe add the shackles at the same time the storm hits? (Huge AoE damage if you move).<br />
<br />
Phase 3 - Storm Champions<br />
50 Minute Timer?! First thing what caught our attention, looked at the screen thinking whoa, this has got to be a hard fight lasting a long time and doing massive damage to us all. What a joke this phase was. We grabbed all three mobs (yes, with some issue as they do ranged damage), but then nuked them down one by one. Hardly any damage on the tanks, and near to no damage on the raid, walk through phase. Clearly the timer was bugged on this.<br />
<br />
Phase 4 - 30 Storm Warriors<br />
This phase we was expecting a rush to hit the 30/30 mark before the timer (15 minutes), once again, we was quite disappointed we stayed over on one side, pulled the five mobs what spawned, and then within seconds, another 5 spawned straight over, so all we did was stay on one side, pull all 5, AoE them down, repeat. Too easy. Scale the damage on the mobs? Scale the health? Add some AoE mechanics?<br />
<br />
Phase 5 - Ruciath<br />
The only fun fight of this whole rift (in my opinion). A giant dragon appeared infront of us and then aggroed us from the start, came over and BOOM 5 people dead. Cleave much? We had to quick rezz and restart the fight, tilting the boss to the side, and decided to nuke him down. The animation seemed to be rather buggy, as he started spinning around in circles whilst attacking the tank, but then went back to normal a few seconds later. Also, his cleave range seems to be huge, I was on the side of the boss, but a bit closer to the head than the body (to heal the tank) and I got cleaved for 5k damage. Seeya later Elux!  His knockback is nothing but annoying, seriously think about changing this mechanic, add some type of air lightning bolt phase? More damage output on the tank? More AoE than the knockback? Would really enhance this boss! The AoE debuff which deals damage on movement is pointless, there's no reason you need to move for this encounter, so there's no real reason for this debuff. Even if you do move, It's not life threatening damage.<br />
<br />
Please Note:<br />
The Reborn members were not levelled to 50 and geared to 50, each of us levelled through questing, geared through dungeons, and did expert groups to gear ourselves up, we're in epic/blue gear and don't have enough 50's to change composition as easy as some other guilds can. We had two Fires of Heaven in our group aswell.<br />
