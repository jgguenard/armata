<div class="message-body">J'attend de voir ce que AV va faire d'ici la release du jeu concernant le macroing et les exploits dans le jeu. À partir de là je prendrai la décision de jouer et d'aller de l'avant ou pas.<br />
<br />
J'ai pas l'intention de recruter d'avantage pour le moment car je ne suis pas en mesure de dire si je vais jouer ou pas.<br />
<br />
Braw joue bcp mais j'ai de la difficulté avec son temperament et j'hésite à lui donner un status de leader.<br />
<br />
Standby ![hr]<br />
J'ai fait un résumer des points qui me préoccupent suite au poste de Tasos aujourd'hui.<br />

<br />
Résumé:<br />
<br />
-Atmosphere: Testers report that the game atmosphere is unmistakably Darkfall.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">Atmosphere is not ok, all those players exploiting mobs and afk macroing in their holdings make the game empty. Running for minutes without seeing anything alive isn't that great. The world is smaller but feel very unfinished in many areas.</span><br />
<br />
-Graphics - World: Overall there is good feedback, players like the ambient lighting, the layout, and the world building. Exploration of the world has been listed by the testers as a very positive experience. Currently we´re working on a fog of war system for the map to make exploration more satisfying. Worldbuilding is an area which has a dedicated team working continuously on improving things so there will be continuous improvements and additions throughout the lifecycle of the game.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">Many monsters are overcamped by large clans and are unobtainable for smaller clans, ie: lesser fire elemental for sulfur and runes. We need a better balance on monsters that are a key to the development of clans.</span><br />
<br />
-The User Interface: Overall, there has been a positive reaction to it with some constructive criticism on certain elements and lack of customization functions. We´re working on improving everything we can pre-launch and we will evaluate making major changes to it as needed.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">Layer of security for clan bank has been asked for years and it's not available for DF:UW, combat logs is too short and the missing bank logs which is crucial for clan leaders is missing. GUI doesn't include any Siege information regarding gold cost and dominion. The GUI miss alot of confirmation windows when buying new skills or declaring a siege etc. The player bags and bank inventory is far to be good. Having only 24 bindable keys 16 for abilities and 8 for tools, weapons, food and potions is not enough.</span><br />
<br />
-The Role System: Players seem to enjoy the role system, and the tactical layer it brings to the game. Overall it has been received well and the general consensus is that this is a good direction for Darkfall Unholy Wars. Without having major issues, balancing is always a concern; we are putting a lot of resources into maintaining a good balance between the classes. Inactive schools and the Primalist class not being in the game yet are also a topic of discussion. We are working on adding these as soon as possible with a priority being on the Primalist class.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">Ok but all roles need to be in for release else you cannot talk about balance. Right now using a role as a main or secondary doesn't seem to work properly regarding mana / stamina cost of skills and re-use time. Much work is needed in the area.</span><br />
<br />
-Character Models: Overall, the testers seem to prefer the new character models we had presented in the past, rather than the ones in the game right now. Consensus on animations is that they are much improved compared to Darkfall Online. Upgrading the character models is in our plans, unfortunately it´s a huge task, having to create all the animations for each one of the 12 races/sexes, customize and fit armors times 12, etc. We made a decision to use the current models in order to launch the game sooner rather than much later, and work out an acceptable solution for upgrading the models as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">I really dislike the new models and the 2010 are excellent, put some effort into it. Many players like to be unique and having all races the same size and shape make the character creation blend without flavors.</span><br />
<br />
-New Player Experience: The overall feeling is positive; the safe zones should benefit all new players and allow them a smooth transition into the game. There is some concern that the safe zones are too large, or too many, or that they may present problems in the future. Measures to deal with these concerns have already been taken on various levels, such as making the safe zones smaller, and there will be further optimizations as needed.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">Remove 2 npc cities per racial area and make more room for hamlet and player cities. There are no point in having so many npc cities with safe zone making the entire world of agon a safe area. One npc city with a capital would be more then ok.</span><br />
<br />
-Feats: Consensus is positive for this new feature which rewards all gameplay styles and incentivizes players to go out and explore the world. Prowess and dominion points, associated with the feats, have been well received. These allow players to improve their characters and contribute to their clans in a way that was not possible in Darkfall Online.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">If you aren't crafting, you have such a hard time to get prowess and It's hard to convince members to give all their mats to some players so that we can maximize the crafting development within the clan. Players with no crafting role should be able to gain prowess more easily.</span><br />
<br />
-Music, Ambient Sounds: Players enjoy the immersive Darkfall Unholy Wars sounds, and music, and there have been few criticisms and issues.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">Music cause major lag and abilities sound effects also. This need to be fixed.</span><br />
<br />
-PvP and Combat: There is a consensus that combat is more tactical. There is a mixed reaction about the slower combat pace. Some players like it because they feel it´s based more on skill and tactics than twitch, others prefer the faster pace. PvP is affected by the debug mode performance issues we discussed earlier so we are evaluating feedback keeping that in mind. Needless to say, combat is our top priority, so we are going to scrutinize everything having to do with this, and evaluate all bits of feedback on it very carefully and move very quickly to make it as awesome as possible.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">Pvp is not fun atm with all the players macroing and the players grinding days and nights on bugged monsters. Find a solution else you will repeat the same mistakes as DF1.</span><br />
<br />
-In-Game Map: includes points of interest, mob spawns, political information, banks, crafting stations, etc. and has been received very well.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">The map miss many important components:Waypoints, Map Annotations, Villages filter with timers, Political map work only once until you relaunch the game.</span><br />
<br />
-Crafting System: Overall positive reviews by the playtesters, a main point being that progression is faster than it was in Darkfall Online.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">Crafting seem to be ok but some tuning need to be done, like weaponsmith seem to lvl slower then bowyer as an exemple. Also gathering mastery should cost 1000 prowess not 10000. No one will buy those for such a long time.<br />
</span><br />
-Clan Control Options: A serious improvement over Darkfall Online, it enhances the clan experience for small and large clans alike.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">Hamlet need more protection since they have no walls, zap tower should cost less for hamlet to craft in term of modules. Hamlet should have forge, workbench and laboratory. More resources also, at least one between farm &amp; quarry and one between grove &amp; mine. Overall cost of modules is far too much even for player cities. </span><br />
<br />
-Player Perspective: The ability to change from first to third person and to the overhead perspective is appreciated by the players.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">yes it's fine</span><br />
<br />
-Character Progression: Overall consensus is that character progression is faster without being too fast.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">Archery progression is much longer then other weapon skills. Other then that many skill seem useless, Stamina efficiency, Exploit Weakness, True shot for the skirmisher seem under power. so far auto attack, puncture and explosive arrow seem to be good.</span><br />
<br />
-Summon Friends: This new feature has been well received when experienced, when it was initially met with serious resistance.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">It's ok as long as re-use time is long enough and portal shard is rare enough.</span></div>
