<br />
<br />
Health: 1,533,08<br />
<br />
Abilities:<br />
Unleash Wrath: Channels this right before he uses Furious Pursuit. This is the signal to run away! Deals about 700-1k dmg a second.<br />
Furious Pursuit: Must be slowed using the shambler slime during this ability. Seems to last 20-30 seconds. He must not hit the tank during this time, and everyone must maintain range.<br />
Enrage: At 10% health he enrages. His movement speed and damage are increased.<br />
<br />
Adds Spawned:<br />
Slimy Shamblers:<br />
4 Spawn, 1 in each corner. They, must be pulled out and killed during the kite phase to slow Duke Letareus. When one dies, they drop a slowing Â“gooÂ” that last about 10 seconds. They have 17,744 health.<br />
<br />
Devious Brownies:<br />
6 spawn at the beginning of the fight, and after every Furious Pursuit. 3 spawn at the front and 3 in the rear. OT #1 will be picking them up in the middle of the raid, and the DPS will AoE them down. They have 35,488 health.<br />
<br />
Ranged Flying Fairies:<br />
They spawn throughout the encounter and randomly shoot raid members. They hit for about 1k, and have 5,145 health. Ranged DPS must manage these.<br />
<br />
Caster Ground Borne Fairies:<br />
OT #1 and #2 will pick these up. 2 Spawn at about 60% into the fight. They have 70k health and must be dealt with quickly. They didn't seem to hit too hard, but could kill healers if they are not picked up quickly. These mobs MUST be interrupted. If not, they do about 70% of the raids health in damage, and can easily cause a wipe. We will assign 2 dps with interrupts to each faerie.<br />
<br />
Damage to Tanks:<br />
Seemed low. The Duke himself seems to hit for about 3-4k a swing. OT#1 will most likely take the most damage when tanking the 6 Devious Brownies.<br />
<br />
Damage to Raid:<br />
Also seemed low until later in the fight. There is assorted spike damage on single targets, and could get high if flying adds are not managed. There was one point in the video, at 3:50, after a furious charge, the whole raid takes 3k or so damage, and the tank almost dies. I have no idea where this damage came from.<br />
<br />
Duke Letareus begins and ends Furious Pursuit at these intervals:<br />
85%:Begins Furious Pursuit<br />
75%:Ends Furious Pursuit<br />
60%:Begins Furious Pursuit<br />
50%:Ends Furious Pursuit<br />
35%:Begins Furious Pursuit<br />
25%:Ends Furious Pursuit<br />

0%:LoL dies[hr]<br />
[size=large][align=center]<b>Strategy</b>[/align][/size]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Pull:<br />
The MT will charge in and tank Duck Leotard where he stands. OT#2 will pick up 2 shamblers and get them to shambler position #1. The rest of the raid will stack behind Duke Letareus at Position A, with the healers clumping on OT#1.<br />
<br />
The Fight:<br />
After the pull, 6 adds will spawn that will be picked up by OT#1. OT#1 will tank the adds in position 3 so they do not melee the healers. The raid will AoE the adds when threat has been established. OT#1 will call out for this. After the adds are down, DPS will continue on the Duke.<br />
<br />
When Unleash Wrath begins to channel the raid will run back to Position B. He will then channel Furious Pursuit and chase the MT. At this point, the first shambler will need to be popped, with the other 3 popped in staggered 10-15 second increments. Melee DPS will focus on the shamblers, while ranged DPS will handle adds. Any free DPS time will be used to DPS the Duke.<br />
<br />
OT #2, will pick up one to two turtles at a time, and bring them down to low health. They will be marked and killed in order, in their respectful positions.<br />
<br />
During this time, the MT will be kiting Duke Retardicus from Â“gooÂ” to Â“gooÂ”, maintaining threat as best he can. It is extremely important that the tank never, EVER get within melee range of Duke Letarious, until his Furious Pursuit is up.<br />
<br />
This is rinse and repeat until the Ground Borne Fairies spawn. At this point, two DPS warriors will each pick one up, and DPS will focus them down and interrupt any spells ASAP. DPS will kill the Faerie marked with #1 first.<br />
<br />
At 25% the add spawns escalate, and become almost unmanageable. OT#1 will pick up the brownies, and the DPS warriors will focus all their attention on interrupting the Ground Borne Faeries. The rest of the raid will burn Letareus to 10%, then clear out the adds. Continue kiting him through slimy shamblers, and you are good to go.<br />
<br />
As long as the shamblers are down in the right spots, and the tank doesn't get caught, this fight should be cake.<br />

<div class="message-body">Duke Letareus<br />
<br />
The first boss of the raid is called Duke Letareus. The fight takes place inside a large, rectangular area. The boss is first situated at the far end and each of the four corners sits a non-aggressive Shambler. This fight is a dps race combined with some execution. You will most likely require a single main tank and two or three offtanks. Sufficient raid healing and minimal main tank healing.<br />
<br />
The Duke has only two mechanics that you have to worry about. Periodically he will call down his Wrath. This is a PBAOE that will kill anyone that gets within range. So melees and tanks need to run out when you see it beginning to cast. Once finished he will Enrage and chase after the tank. Everyone must get out of the way as he will continuously cleave and instantly kill anyone not a tank. A tank will not survive very long.<br />
<br />
This is where the Shamblers come into play. While the tank is engaged with the Duke one or two players must pull out a Shambler each and place them strategically away from the rest of the raid. The best placement, typically, would have the raid centered in the middle of the encounter area and have the Shamblers on the outer portions of the room. When killed the Shamblers produce a purple ground effect that will slow down the Duke when he runs through it.<br />
<br />
So when the Duke starts casting his Wrath, the Shamblers should be killed and the main tank should position himself so that when the Duke finishes his cast he will head towards the tank through the purple ground effect. The Duke will only become un-Enraged once enough damage is done to him. Depending on your raid´s strength, you might need two Shamblers to knock him out of enrage.<br />
<br />
As all of this is going on you will have adds. There are three different types, Brownies, Pixies and Faeries. Brownies are melee mobs that continuously spawn from the start that need to be gathered up and off-tanked. Pixies slowly spawn throughout the fight and fly in the air. They act as a DPS check so that you can´t take your time on the Duke. Up to three Faeries spawn starting around when the Duke is at 50%. These are the most dangerous as they cast Fae Barrage which hits all raid members for substantial damage. However this spell can be interrupted.<br />
<br />
If you can manage the execution, dps and the adds you will be able to defeat the Duke.</div>
