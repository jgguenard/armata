<div class="message-body"><b>5. Match Reporting</b><br />
<br />
All members participating in the match MUST use the Paladin anti-cheat client to check-in to the match.  Failure to check-in to a match can result in forfeit losses being issued and match results being forced whether they were played or not.<br />
<br />
Captains and A-Captains of the winning team are required to report the results of their played/finished matches immediately.  You will be required to upload a Â“statusÂ” screenshot file and a Â“victory scoreboardÂ” screenshot for verification of the players and results of the said match.<br />
<br />
To obtain the status screenshot you must have Â“consoleÂ” enabled and type status ingame during the match (preferably during a pause and/or before the starting Â“hornÂ” sounds ingame)<br />
<br />
6.4 Ringing: Players are not permitted to provide their accounts for use by other Players. Doing so is considered Ringing, which is pretending to be someone they are not, and will result in all violators involved being disqualified from the event.<br />
<br />
6.5 Stand-Ins: Under no circumstances can teams use a Â“stand-inÂ” during any official match in the event.  All extra players are required to be registered and readied up on the teams´ roster otherwise they are ineligible to play.  If used the team utilizing the Â“stand-inÂ” player will face immediate removal from the event and if found the opposing agreeing team will be removed as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>10.1 Match Settings: The settings for all Tournament Matches are as follows:</u></b><br />
<br />
Game Type: Captain´s Mode<br />
Version: Tournament<br />
Map: Default<br />
Team Size: Five versus Five<br />
Server: US West/East unless both teams agree to play on another server.<br />
Dire/Radiant: The team designated as the &quot;Home&quot; team will pick which side they want to play as.<br />
First Ban: The team designated as the &quot;Home&quot; team will have the choice to ban a champion first.<br />
<br />
It is the responsibility of both Teams to verify that the Match settings are correct prior to starting a Match. Once a Match has begun, Teams may not restart or replay due to incorrect Match Settings, unless both Teams mutually agree to do so.<br />
<br />
10.7. Roster Changes: A team will be limited to a maximum of 9 players on their roster. Roster changes, including additions or removals of Players are allowed and enabled on the site only until Thursday, October 25 at 11:59 PM Central Time. To have a roster change done, use the website or contact an Official.<br />
<br />
10.8. Game Chat: Game chat is permitted as long as it is done in a sportsmanlike manner. All chat should nonetheless be kept to a minimum. Chat violations fall under unsportsmanlike conduct and may be disputed, resulting in an Official enforcing a Penalty.<br />
<br />
10.11 Match Spectators:  Spectators are not allowed unless specifically allowed by an admin. Teams may be asked to allow their match to be broadcasted by Tournament organizers.<br />
<br />
10.12 Pausing: Pausing should only occur in the spirit of sportsmanship. A pause can occur directly within the first few seconds of play for users to verify the opponents STEAMIDs, record any demos, buy starting items or select heroes from the draft.  Player drops and disconnects can warrant a pause during the live match.  Please in open chat say Â“pÂ” or Â“pauseÂ” to let your opponent know of the upcoming game pause and possible reason as to why it is occurring. Before a match can be unpaused you must ask your opponent if they are ready in open chat, once an agreement is made to unpause you can continue with the game.  Pauses during the live game should only occur for player disconnects and server/player latency issues, none other.<br />
