Update, February 5th<br />
We apologize for being absent from posting on the forums for a while, however, we have been listening to your feedback while working hard on the game and all the supporting activities for it.<br />
<br />
This week we're issuing a large balancing patch which has to do with our findings and research into gameplay balance so far. Your feedback has been very helpful in this and we think you'll find the changes improve the gameplay experience in a big way.<br />
<br />
The progress on the &quot;state of the beta&quot; post submitted for your comments, was paused because of the feedback on it: The data we had been meticulously collecting before the post and the feedback under that thread are somewhat contradictory.<br />
<br />
It's understandable that negative comments are usually more forthcoming than the positive ones, and of course it's not scientific to get your data from the people posting on the forums alone. The most active testers are not necessarily the most vocal posters and most of the people playing the game are not even on the forums. On the other hand we take this feedback very seriously, so the public post we wanted to make was postponed.<br />
<br />
In any case, we're working on conducting surveys regarding the beta experience which will include all of our beta participants and this way we should be able to get more reliable data. The state of the beta post won't include many details until then, and will serve to inform people that the beta is going smoothly and that the game is stable and playable.<br />
<br />
I'll use this opportunity to address a few of the points brought up in the thread:<br />
<br />
Performance: The last patch has improved things considerably and you will see improvements in every patch. Debug mode is still in because if it wasn't we'd lose a lot of information associated with bug reporting. We don't want to turn it off yet because it helps us get to the bottom of things a lot faster and allows us to fix problems a lot sooner. We know that the largest source of performance issues is the debug mode and we don't anticipate serious performance issues in the live game. We ask for your patience for a little while longer.<br />
<br />
Cheating: You may be seeing some instances of it, this is mainly because we're not running our detection at the moment. In Darkfall Online, third party programs were banned very efficiently to the point where cheat providers discontinued their Darkfall cheat support. We're looking to improve on that in Darkfall Unholy Wars.<br />
<br />
GUI: We're redesigning backpack and bank based on your feedback and if we don't have it in by launch, we'll have it in soon after. We're also looking at adding customization, however this will take some time.<br />
<br />
Summoning Friends: We're keeping it but we'll keep evaluating it. We feel that the long cooldown and interruption safeguards are enough to keep it from becoming a problem.<br />
<br />
Archery Progression: This has been addressed already, and we'll keep improving balance between the classes, as you will see in this week's patch.<br />
<br />
Primalist: We're doing our best to have him in before launch.<br />
<br />
Number of holdings: They are fewer than those in Darkfall Online, but we have plans on adding new ones post-launch, something we didn't do in the previous game.<br />
<br />
Launch Date: There's the issue of the launch date which concerns a lot of the players. We do have an internal target and we have reported a tentative date to partners and it's not far off. We'll announce the launch date as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
These are not all the points, but we'll address them as we go. We have also collected a huge list of your questions and we'll be getting to them as soon as possible. The next communication should be the patch notes for our patch, scheduled on Thursday.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.</blockquote>
