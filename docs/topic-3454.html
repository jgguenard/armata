5/5 Intimidation 5% dmg reduction<br />

<hr class="bbcode_rule" />
My Reasoning why no points spent elsewhere:<br />
Paladin:<br />
Steely Resolve - No real need for CC reduction<br />
Martial Shield - no real need to increase attk points threat is fine w/o<br />
Vengeful Wrath - incease dmg to Realiation Disarming Counterblow and Pal Reprisal not important enough to consider<br />
Paladin Devotion - No need to break CC as of yet<br />
Gracefull Underpressure - No need as of yet to increase to hit<br />
Karmic Resolution - Heal Pali for 15 -30% dmg dealt from DCB and Ret .. the heal isn't worth the points spent.<br />
Reverent Protection - Useless Ability as stands Please See Post #5<br />
Improved Reverent Protection 4-8 sec duration increase is not worth a point when the ability itself is mechanically flawed vs dmg taken.<br />
Shield of Chosen - The minuscule plus Armor is not really warranted as AC does nothing against non-physical dmg.<br />
Paladins Reprisal - An actually good ability for a trash clearing build, but not a very good ability otherwise. Not worth the point.<br />
<br />
Reaver:<br />
Eathral Bond: Power Cost reduc of abilities - threat isn't a matter so pool isn't a facter in order to spam to gain threat.<br />
Power In the Blood - A possible nice to have, but points better spent elsewhere.<br />
Shadow of Dread - No nead for fear. Might be a good off tank ability if it petrified a mob in terror rooting it in place, vs running around.<br />
Tempered Will - No real need to break free of CC yet.<br />
Grisley Works - 3-9 % health gain upon kill is good for a trash clearing build but other wise points better spent elsewhere.<br />
Mastery of the Abyss 1-5 targets heals war for dmg done.. again another trash clear ability.<br />
Wasting Away - str reduction debuff not worth the points at the tier it is at and with out debuffing something else<br />
Cripling Infestation 5-15 less dmg ?? what type of dmg might be usefull<br />
Improved Mastery of the Abyss no need for the improved if there is not a need for the first one.<br />
Enraged Essence - maybe needed for a utility build, but with the nerf taking it down to 5% in the last patch and the fact it will no longer stack with Beast Masters Enraged Companion not really worth the point spent.<br />
Creaping Death - to far up the latter to get points better spent elsewhere no real need when have healers.<br />
<br />
Warlord:<br />
10 dumped in Warlord for the dmg reduction and to get the Sergeant's Command ability which is a must for mob control.<br />
<br />
Over all mechanic of Warrior damage mitigation is slightly flawed overall.<br />
<br />
AC only mitigates physical damage<br />
Parry only parries physical damage<br />
Dodge only dodges physical damage<br />
Block only blocks a portion of physical damage<br />
Spell damage reduction is only gained through points spent into a soul tree<br />
There is NO elemental damage mitigation at all.<br />
<br />
Possible Solutions to the WAR DMG INTAKE problem.<br />
<br />
1. Armor Class to include sub spell/elemtal dmg mitigation value.<br />
<br />
2. Block Chance to deflect or reduce all or a portion of portion of spell/elemental damage.<br />
<br />
3. Endurance to increase resists as well as health.<br />
<br />
4. Re-look non-physical damage reduction across warrior souls and adjust to include elemental damage reduction, making the current available in earlier tiers, increasing their value where they are at in their current tiers, or reallocate non-phys reduction abilities so they are not spread to far to thin.<br />
<br />
5. Or combination of the above.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have 3 builds that i swap around in based on the situation<br />
My melee aoe tank build is 32 paladin 17 warlord 17 Voidknight<br />
32 pal for lights decree and paladin's reprisal (have to use alot of filler points on stuff i dont really need just to get to here)<br />
17 warlord for the group support be it call to arms or call to focus fire<br />
17 Voidknight for thehp/str buff thru pacts and spell sunder and spellbreaker(nerfed to bad so i might remove)<br />
With this build i have ample aoe threat the ability to give group a few bonus but lack alot of magic reduction<br />
<br />
32 paladin 26 Voidknight 8 reaver<br />
This build is aoe with a good amount of magic reduction<br />
32 pally for the aoe and defensive stuff<br />
26 reaver have all the stuff as the previous build but i add into improved void and riftshield(this ability needs to be a little stronger and i dont me make it longer duration)<br />
8 reaver for the 5 in the hp boost and levtover 3 into the damage reduction<br />
<br />
32warlord 24 paladin 10 reaver<br />
This is my heavy support /singletarget build<br />
32 warlord up to rallying call and locked down with hit reduction on the ability has all the call increases but not the regen/increased healing<br />
24 paladin for survivability and agro /spell reduction<br />
<br />
10 reaver for the 5 in hp increase and 5 in damage reduction<br />
<br />
as far as i have tested these seem to be the most solid for the way i play.The biggest problem i can see in any of these builds is like everyone else is saying the mitigation of NON PHYSICAL damage types<br />
As far as i can see the physical end of warrior is either on par or close to par what a plate tank should be.<br />
I wish the devs would add identity to the 3 tanking souls right now warlord has a nice idenity but needs some tuning to be more then a squishy tank type. The paladin needs that thing that says &quot;YOU CANT KILL ME EASILY&quot; and the voidknight is in such bad shap that i dont know where you were going with it..it has no early silence for a tank that supposed to be caster unfriendly it also doesnt even have a normal interrupt early on..44 points in is way to late. This tank type should also be a bit stronger against all forms of magic attacks. You have supposidly fixed the crit thing with the new stat so will test that when i get the stat if ever. Anyway just so input so do with it what you will<br />

<br />
This build is like the title says &quot;Anti-Mage&quot;, problem is that it does very little against Mage mobs. I'll break it down<br />
***Void Knight***<br />
<br />
- Pain Tolerance/Improved Pain Tolerance - This should be 1 talent like the Reaver/Paladin, no reason why we should be doing double the points for the same result. I fell this is a fill in as the Improved Slot could be used for something much more useful.<br />
- Insaintable Hunger - This ability is useless in combat as your chances of draining a mob's mana to nothing is pretty slim, especially against anything in experts or bosses. This seems to be more pvp than anything but its used as a fill-in.<br />
- Ravenous Strength - Selected this over Rift Tap and Surge as the STR can help block, remmeber we want to be defensive and tank, the other talents on the row do not help at all.<br />
- Spell Sunder - Maybe the best ability on the tree.<br />
- Efficient Conversion - Still currently broken but can be helpful when getting off Disrcharge or Rift Shield. Currently does not lower energy costs.<br />
- Ravenous Defense - +50% Armor, why do we get this in the Void Knight tree when armor does not help against magic? Problem with this ability is it is far too spammy. 6 second buff? Energy Retention would be better served increasing the duration of these buffs and not pacts.<br />
- Spellbreaker - Nerfed, removed off of build.<br />
- Devourer - This ability needs to be put down in place of Improved Pain Tolerance. The Void Knight does not become magically defensive until too high up into the tree. This ability is supposed to set the Void Knight from the rest of the souls and currently at 15% max compared to its previous 35% just isn't selling. We are hardly more defensive against mages.<br />
- Residual Absorption - Doesn't protect against any of the spells that it needs to protect again (Like Greenscales -75% healing debuff)<br />
- Rift Summon - Acts like Warlords FT that pulls the mob (Seargents Command). Geometry makes this ability not worth the points or cooldown.<br />
- Rift Shield - This ability is good for what it is, however currently 5k magic damage in experts, this thing goes down FAST. Something like this would be nice for all damage and not just magic.<br />
- Replenish - Needs to be re-worked completely. It gives WAY too little hp for the pacts gained. (Would help if you guys didn't interchange HP with Endurance so much so players can know what they will be getting back per pact)<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
- Stalwart Shield - Necessity, we are dependent on block to survive.<br />
- Defender - Trying to be as defensive as possible even though the diminishing returns are harsh.<br />
- Enduring Stamina - Necessity<br />
- Aggressive Guardian - Tooltip needs to state is it agro on attacks with no agro, or agro in general? The internal modifier?<br />
- Hardened Will - This ability is prime to be 9% ALL damage reduction.<br />
- Martial Shield - Use the attack points to help fire off Pact Conversion to keep armor up (even though I hate it). Also helps firing off Charge...since Pacts have no better usage defensively<br />
- Steely Resolve - Self explanatory.<br />
- Light's Hammer - Self explanatory.<br />
- Paladin's Devotion - Wish it broke all effects (like combined with the Reaver ability). Helps against Greenscale encounters and Scarn in DD.<br />
- Balance of Power - I feel this needs to be retuned to where we have a greater effect on increasing its damage output. Right now, making 9times out of 10 a paladin will have a 1hander or shield, the damage is rather set as opposed this was effected by AP/+% damage modifications.<br />
- Tip of Balance - Follow BoP, its nearly a set 150 heal. Good for soloing easy content, non-existant in harder content.<br />
- Shield of the Chosen - This talent is half-implemented, you took the same buff and just swapped out with a low amount of energy. The least that could be done make it 10% block or make it damage reduction. Armor is overly used as it is. With raid content fighting mobs higher level, it seems the first buff is more useful for the hit chance.<br />
- Paladin's Reprisal - Good ability, not worthy of the top spot. This should be a branch ability and replaced with a more defensive ability.<br />
<br />
Reaver<br />
Strong COnstitution - Necessity<br />
Plague Bringer - For extra AE agro<br />
Imbued Armor - These are the kind of talents we should be using. however just 5% is so minor.<br />
<br />
The problem with this build is you can't really do anything to protect yourself. Outside of Touch of Life and Aggressive Block, I have no other defense to throw up in combat, the class currently holds the most simple boring gameplay as its basically spam your aoe agros, FT when need be, and position the mob. There are tons of ways to readjust how we manage the damage intake. Also, take out block since its not a 100% Guarsantee, its not a good comparison for us against Riftstalker mitigation<br />
