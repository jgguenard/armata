<br />
Matron Zamira is a fun fight which requires a lot of communication from your whole raid. It takes a very long time per attempt to experiment with one mechanic and some of them are located on floors other than Matron´s. Great DPS will help your raid a tremendous amount because it reduces the amount of time spent in phase 2. As long as you've killed Murdantix you have should have no problem with DPS on this boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Difficulty level: 8 (Hard)<br />
Health: 9.8m<br />
Hard enrage timer: Unknown<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2 tanks<br />
5 healers<br />
2 support (1 archon, 1 bard)<br />
11 DPS<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 1: Raid<br />
<br />
Phase 1 is split into two parts somewhat. You will have 18 raid members fighting the boss on her platform dealing with all of her abilities while two raid members, a healer and a DPS, get teleported upstairs and deal with those mechanics of the fight. First I will explain the strategy for the raid, and then the group that teleports.<br />
<br />
When you first pull the boss you will be standing at the door way looking towards her in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The boss does not move so you must bring the fight to her. Tanks should obviously tank her where she stands while the raid spreads out around her. She will apply a stacking debuff on the tanks called Matron's Curse which increases damage taken by 5% and reduces healing received by 10%. Tanks want to swap at 4 stacks or else they will be taking too much damage to heal through.<br />
<br />
You want to spread out because she casts Dark Concussion, an ability similar to Infiltrator Johlen's bombs, under a random players feet that will explode, deal damage, and knock players back. This ability is not a huge deal but it does lower DPS which is a pretty important part of this fight because the more damage you deal during phase 1 the shorter phase 2 is.<br />
<br />
Throughout the fight Matron will cast Mark of Oblivion on one raid member which slows them. Also, at the end of the debuffs 6 second timer it will spawn an add called Nightmare Spirit that casts AoE and single target abilities on the highest threat target while also healing the boss. You want your DPS to swap to this add and kill it as soon as possible while keeping it interrupted.<br />
<br />
When the boss reaches 18-25 stacks of Corrupt Gestation you want one of your Tome of the Library clickers to remove the buff from the boss. Doing so will cause adds to spawn equivalent to the number of Corrupt Gestation stacks. The adds that spawn are called Child of Night and have about ~30k health. They spawn in a radius around the boss and must be picked up by both tanks to spread the damage between the two. Melee should run out of melee range and DPS should wait until all of the adds are picked up so no one gets killed instantly. A good way to help tanks with threat is to use threat redirections such as incriminate.<br />
<br />
Once the tanks pick the adds up make sure you cooldown both tanks and AoE them down as fast as possible. Ideally, you want those Child of Night adds dead in about 10-15 seconds because cooldowns will start to fade. Once these adds die you have experienced all of Phase 1 and continue this until Phase 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 1: Tome of the Library Group<br />
<br />
You need one healer and one DPS, preferably a warrior and chloromancer, to deal with the four Tomes of the Library which will reset the bosses buff stacks.<br />
<br />
The two players assigned to the tomes on the top floor of the room cannot get to the spot alone. At the beginning of the fight one raid member must activate a Bottom Floor Tablet which will allow these two players to teleport upstairs. These tablets are located in the NE, NW, SE, and SW corners of the lowest floor. It is preferred a healer clicks the tablets because you take 1.6k dmg per second when on the bottom floor.<br />
<br />
Picture of tablets.<br />
<br />
The middle floor is used to teleport to the top floor.<br />
<br />
Once the tablet is activated the platform above will light up. The two raid members assigned to the top floor at the beginning of the fight will be there the whole time. When you first arrive up there you will not have anything to do because the boss will not have many stacks of her buff yet. Simply wait until the boss gets to 18-25 stacks or until one of your tanks/raid leaders tell you to use the tome to reset the buffs on the boss. You cannot use a tome within one minute of each other because you receive a debuff, and if you try to use another tome with this debuff on you will instantly die.<br />
<br />
After you use the tome a gold beam will be channeled towards the boss for a second or two, and then Chlid of Night adds will spawn in a radius around the boss. See Phase 1: Raid to learn how to defeat these adds.<br />
<br />
When you use a Tome of the Library upstairs it will spawn one Scowling Shade add at every table where a tome is or was besides the one you just used. These adds hit for ~1-1.5k and should be tanked by the warrior DPS. Make sure you kill all of the adds that spawn or else too many will be clumped in one area eventually.<br />
<br />
Picture of top floor.<br />
<br />
For phase 1 the tome clickers repeat this until all tomes are used. Once all tomes are used Phase 2 begins.<br />
<br />
Note: After tomes are used they do not respawn.<br />
<br />
There are two different strategies for phase two because one includes dispelling Mark and Host of Oblivion (unintended and no longer possible) and the other is Trion´s intended strategy (we do not have full details on this yet).<br />
<br />
Intended<br />
<br />
Phase 2: Raid<br />
<br />
Phase 2 is exactly the same as Phase 1 except there are no more tomes to remove Corrupt Gestation. Also, it is applied at a slower rate, so consider this the soft enrage timer on the fight. Phase 2 lasts from the time you use your last tome until the boss is dead, so the more DPS during phase 1 the better.<br />
<br />
One ability is added at the start of Phase 2 and another one at 25% health. Host of Oblivion starts at the beginning of Phase 2 and is exactly the same as Mark of Oblivion except on the whole raid including pets. We killed the boss before hot fixes so this next part is our guess on how to stop Host based on what we've read. In order to stop Host of Oblivion from spawning 20 adds on 20 players at the same time you must channel all the Skulls on the top floor to stop its cast. The raid cannot do anything about this, and have to rely on their group of players up top to save them (better explained in the next section, Phase 2: Tome of Library Group).<br />
<br />
At 25% health there is an ability the boss casts which needs to be interrupted or else one raid member will die. Make sure you have two dedicated interrupters, one ranged and one melee, and this mechanic is a piece of cake. It will be used very often until the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
Phase 2: Tomes of the Library Group<br />
<br />
As stated in Phase 1: Tomes of the Library Group, the tomes are no longer there. They are now replaced by skulls which also give a debuff to the person who clicks it. If they click another skull within one minute of each other they will instantly die.<br />
<br />
During Phase 2 an ability called Host of Oblivion is used, which is a raid wide Mark of Oblivion. To counter this ability we believe all skulls must be clicked simultaneously when the boss emotes to cast the ability. During Phase 1, though, you only send two players up and there are four tables with skulls on them. We killed the boss before hot fixes so this next part is our guess on how to stop Host based on what we've read. You have to send two more players upstairs to join them, so you now have four players on the top platform of the room. When Host is cast al four players must click the skull they are assigned to. If a skull is not clicked then adds will spawn on all players and pets and wipe the raid instantly. Due to the one minute debuff you get after clicking a skull you need to rotate another four players up in order to stop the next Host cast, so you should have two groups of four rotating to click skulls.<br />
<br />
Unintended<br />
<br />
Phase 2: AoE Dispel Easy Mode Strategy (No longer possible!!!)<br />
<br />
This is the unintended strategy which the majority of early guilds who killed the boss have used to defeat Matron because they simply did not know it was unintended. After Phase 1 the two members of your raid would rejoin the raid back on the boss´s main platform and join the fight. No more players go upstairs, ever.<br />
<br />
To complete Phase 2 of the encounter you continue the fight as normal and assign Groups 1 and 2 to the left, and Groups 2 and 3 to the right for when Host is casted. Make sure you mark two raid members for people to know who they are stacking on, and dismiss all pets because Host affect pets too. When the boss emotes that Host is about to be used the raid runs to their designated spots for clerics to AoE dispel their groups. If done properly you will get no adds and you continue the fight like this until she dies.<br />
<br />
Make sure you interrupt her cast from 25% until she is dead or else it will kill a random raid member every time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Corrupt Gestation Â– Stacks on Matron which increases the amount of damage she deals over time. Gains one stack every 5 seconds or so.<br />
Matron's Curse Â– Every stack increases damage taken by 5% and reduces healing taken by 10%.<br />
Dark Concussion Â– Casted under a random player in the raid and explodes almost instantly. Deals ~2k damage and knocks player back.<br />
Mark of Oblivion Â– Applies a debuff to a random raid member and slows them. At the end of the debuff (6 seconds) a Nightmare Spirit will spawn which needs to be picked up by a tank and interrupted.<br />
Host of Oblivion Â– Exactly like Mark of Oblivion but on the whole raid. Can be dispelled, but you are supposed to channel the skulls to stop the ability.<br />
Spawned Adds:<br />
Child of Night<br />
Wrath of the Night Â– Single target ability used on highest threat target. Interruptible.<br />
Nightmare Spirit<br />
Arc of the Night Â– Casted on highest threat target and deals ~1.5k damage per second. Interruptible.<br />
Wrath of the Night Â– Single target ability used on highest threat target. Interruptible.<br />
Scowling Shade<br />
Spawn after using a Tome of the Library. Have 27,000 health and deal ~1.1k damage per hit to DPS warriors.<br />
Spawned Utilities:<br />
Bottom Floor Tablets Â– Requires a two second channel to use. Activates the platform one floor above to teleport players to the highest floor in the room where Tome of the Library and Skulls are used.<br />
Tome of the Library Â– Requires a two second channel to use. Shoots a gold beam towards Matron and however many stacks of the Corrupt Gestation buff she has is the amount of adds that will spawn. The adds that spawn are Child of Night.<br />
Skull Â– Used to stop Host of Oblivion cast. Spawns in place of Tome of the Library when they are used.</div>

<div class="message-body">So my guild has figured out that once you use all 4 tomes:<br />
1. They do not re-spawn<br />
2. Short duration after last tome is used she does Host of Souls<br />
We have tried pushing stacks till 22-25, and are roughly doing 18-20% per tome use.<br />
We get her to around ~20% before she casts Host of Oblivion; we have tried the following to survive:<br />
1. Clicking a tome before<br />
2. Clicking a tome during<br />
3. Clicking a tome after<br />
4. Clicking (1-4) at same time all during/before/after<br />
5. Using stairs as LoS methods.<br />
6. Zoning upstairs in order to again LoS<br />
7. Pray (hasn´t worked for anything yet, why start now /sadface)<br />
8. Cleansing /w AoE cleanses (seemed to work but a few adds would almost always spawn, i am thinking cause pets don´t get hit with cleanse)<br />
Been wiping consistently now for 3 days or raiding @ 20%, losing sleep and could REALLY use a break if you can find it in your heart to help me lol<br />
guilds hitting 22-24k raid dps so not sure if that´s a huge fail on our behalf as i am not certain of the guilds raid dps for actual kills.<br />
Thanks in advance[hr]<br />
That´s pretty frustrating for sure. Unfortunately now that they nerfed cleanse, we won´t know a fully workable strat til next reset. What we were doing before, is grouping up into 2 different groups and using 1 AoE cleanse on each, and then spreading back out. We also had everyone despawn their pets before that. We would still get some adds spawn some reason (2 per host I think?), and ended up off-tanking 4 of them or so when she died.<br />
Getting her to 20% HP before Host sounds perfectly normal/fine, I don´t think you´re expected to kill her before she casts Host. I assume you get 1 add spawn every 20-30 sec now that they completely removed the dispel mechanic?<br />
All I know is that the skulls definitely have some purpose to help combat the Host mechanic, and I suspected it´d be clicking all 4 simultaneously while she was casting it. If that´s not it, then I´m sorta stumped as well.</div>

<div class="message-body">This is a video of Vantage's latest downing of Matron Zamira. Before I get to the strategy that is viewed in the video - Vantage has now transferred to the Briarcliff server and is recruiting exceptional people. Visit <a href="http://vantage.guildhosting.org/">vantage.guildhosting.org</a> for more information and to apply.<br />
<br />
The strategy:<br />
<br />
Not many people have been able to down Matron Zamira since the recent two patches which made her incredibly harder. As such, even guilds that had previously downed her were having to modify their strategies.<br />
<br />
Raid Comp:<br />
<br />
3 Tanks (preferably no rogue tanks although we did it with 1)<br />
2 clerics<br />
1 chloro<br />
Bard<br />
Chloro<br />
Mad AoE burst damage<br />
<br />
The encounter requires a tank swap (2 tanks) and a separate tank for the adds. Do NOT have a rogue tank the adds. The add tank needs to have an interrupt and it is his jobs to interrupt the adds that heal. All adds should always be pulled to the boss in order to die via AoE.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the encounter, one of your tanks needs to go below and activate the teleporter. A rogue is then to take the teleporter to the top platform and it is his soul job to solo the adds via kiting and activate the tomes when called out via the tanks. Use either a MM spec or Sab spec to easily solo kill them. The mobs have 22k HP.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see in the video all ranged needs to be positioned with an appropriate amount of space between each other - behind the tanks. This is to ensure that if the tanks get knocked back via the AOE that they aren't out of range of heals. Melee need to spread out around the back of the boss. The boss does not cleave however you want to avoid dropping the aoe on the tanks.<br />
<br />
The boss has a stack effect on her and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it. With each stack she and her AOE hit harder. After 15 stacks your rogues will want to pull out of melee range as the AOE will one shot them and it isn't dodgeable in melee range however it is quite easy to do at range. Your warriors will want to pull out at around 20 stacks. Rogues choosing to remain sabdancer can run into melee for their puncture and Deadly Strike once an AOE goes out.<br />
<br />
When the boss hits 25 stacks the person up top needs to clear them. There is an 11 second time between the person clicking the item and the adds spawning and in that time it is imperative that all dps gets ready to blow the shit out of the adds ASAP.<br />
<br />
By waiting so long to clear the stacks and by only using one person up top, your raid dps should be exceptionally high and you will never run into the massive AOE that so clearly wipes pretty much everyone on this encounter.<br />
<br />
Notes: Hideous Blast NEEDS to be interupted at all times.</div>

<br />
Two Reaver Hybrid tanks switching on Matron;<br />
One 32 point Warlord tank on Nightmare Spirits.<br />
We did not have a Rogue tank online and I haven't looked at the exact spread of physical and magical damage on the encounter (though magic burst is what will kill you). It may be possible to have a Rogue tank Matron almost easily as a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Just as important as the tanks we used, here's the Tomes we used:<br />
<br />
1st Tome at 35 stacks;<br />
2nd Tome at 25 stacks;<br />
3rd Tome at 20 stacks (maybe 25, don't recall).<br />
Basically, your first Tome is your safest to go long with, as long as melee get out of the middle around ~18 stacks so they don't get one-shot by ground AOE. The reason for this is that Revolting Ichor has not started casting and your potential burst damage is very limited. We found it was possible to go 45 stacks but it was too rough to rely on for a kill.<br />
<br />
During the first and third mini-add phases, the 32 Warlord used Rallying Command. This was the difference between a very stable kill of adds and our untimely demise, particularly on the first Tome with high stacks. During the second, we used Aid Command. The 32 Warlord kept Spotter's Order and Cutting Distraction applied to the boss at nearly all times.<br />
<br />
Healer's Covenant was used on both tanks every mini-add phase. We know the adds inherit Threat from the primary or secondary Threat on Matron, though we haven't nailed exactly which, so we shield both to be safe.<br />
<br />
As often as possible (nearly all of the time), the timing of the mini-add phase on Matron coincided with one of us being clear of the stacking healing debuff Matron applied to us. This allowed the free tank to use AOE Taunt safely, because even if it hit the boss it would not lead to a tank death. If AOE Taunt only picked up adds (good thing!) and not the boss, we'd follow it up with a single target taunt on the boss.<br />
<br />
Knockbacks on the encounter don't begin on top of the current active tank. For this reason, we stayed apart from each other, preventing us from being knocked back while we were tanking. Additionally, this ensured that we were always able to interrupt.<br />
<br />
Aside from tanking information, Bluedot wrote up a fuller guide here:<br />

You can reflect freely in between there and rack up a huge amount of stacks on the boss. Also, running 2 pyro/dom for arresting presence rotation we are able to keep multiple adds silence and not worry about focusing them down as splash and aoe kills them. Pyro/Dom really doesn't lose much DPS for the utility it brings.</div>
