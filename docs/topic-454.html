Medieval low-fantasy MMORPG<br />
<br />
Embers of Caerus takes influence from the medieval ages in an attempt to help create a realistic and believable environment... only slightly tainted by magic and meddling gods.<br />
<br />
Level-less, classless character advancement<br />
<br />
Play and advance your character how you want instead of adhering to preset roles and restrictions!<br />
<br />
Massive, seamless, persistent world on one massive server<br />
<br />
The world of Caerus is absolutely massive! (approx 44,000 sq km.) It presents countless opportunities for exploration, trade, war, and more! Discover secret locations, hidden treasure troves, dungeons, resources, and absolutely breathtaking hand-crafted landscapes! What is more, it is all hosted on a single world server. Everyone plays on the same server, and has the same chance to shape the world and its story!<br />
<br />
&quot;Living World&quot; dynamic ecology<br />
<br />
Discover what it's like to live in a world that not only reacts to you, but lives its own life as well! Migrating herbivores, prowling wolf packs, and even roaming bandit gangs share the same world with you!<br />
<br />
Dynamic weather and seasons<br />
<br />
Weather on Caerus can be unpredictable, beautiful, and sometimes downright ruthless! Each area of the world offers different climates, weather, and challenges!<br />
<br />
Rich back-story and player-influenced evolving storylines<br />
<br />
Just because it's a sandbox doesn't mean it doesn't have a story! In fact, not only is there a main plot, but also several major subplots and countless small stories to experience and take part in! All of which can have an impact felt by players everywhere!<br />
<br />
Dynamic Event Team<br />
<br />
We at Forsaken Studios believe nothing replaces good old-fashioned storytelling, and that's why since day one we have planned to unleash a team of experienced GMs to help make the world come to life right before your very eyes!<br />
<br />
Immersive first-person view<br />
<br />
Not only will you see the world through your character's eyes, but you will experience it as they do! Whether it's a frightening dungeon, or a fight to the death, first-person view puts you in the best seat in the house!<br />
<br />
Player skill-driven combat<br />
<br />
Make the difference in battle with your personal abilities, not a character level, character age, or a set of magic items you spent 2 weeks grinding dungeons for!<br />
<br />
Full loot, open PvP combat<br />
<br />
Fight for your own reasons, not just because a storyline tells you your character must hate the other guys, but beware the consequences. Whatever you fight for, don't forget to loot the spoils of war!<br />
<br />
Death Hurts<br />
<br />
In EoC death hurts, badly. Not only do you drop your gear, but your character has to recover from their wounds before they will be much help to anyone - assuming their body survives their death at all!<br />
<br />
Involved, dynamic naval systems<br />
<br />
Man ships and help turn the tide of battle! Raise sails, row oars, fire weapons; or just set sail and explore the vast oceans. Beware the terrors of the deep!<br />
<br />
Realistic siege warfare<br />
<br />
Build siege camps, besiege keeps, castles, fortresses and more with siege engines and tactics. Cut their supply lines and starve them out, or break down the walls and take it by force!<br />
<br />
Territorial controls<br />
<br />
Claim and manage land, resources, and the towns and cities within! Fight to protect your most valuable assets - your people!<br />
<br />
Player-controlled political and legal systems<br />
<br />
Set your land's laws as you see fit and have your guards enforce them. Negotiate political agreements with in-game tools, forging alliances, lease agreements, and more!<br />
<br />
Player housing and city building<br />
<br />
Acquire land and build your home, or perhaps start a town center which could eventually grow into a sprawling city and hub of a nation!<br />
<br />
Rich player-controlled market and economy<br />
<br />
Nearly every item is either created or supplied by players. Invest in resources, goods, or the businesses themselves, become a rich tycoon, or just strive to crash the market of your competitor to make them an easier target for the local bandits.<br />
<br />
Extensive crafting systems<br />
<br />
Gather and refine raw resources into usable goods. Create each piece individually with exceptional care that brings in extreme prices, or manage your own workshop that mass produces high-demand goods. Whatever niche you choose, rest assured each and every piece you create has a purpose, and someone out there needs it!<br />
<br />
Unique and challenging magic system<br />
<br />
Magic is a very rare and extremely powerful tool. No longer are you limited to just combat magic like fireballs and lightning bolts; instead show the world what a real magi is capable of. Just be wary of the dangers that come with being one!<br />
<br />
Player-influenced or created religions<br />
<br />
Found your own religion and gather support in an effort to will a deity into existence to watch down over you from the heavens, empowering you in return for your service; or choose to resurrect one of the old gods and set out on quests to discover how to raise them from their eternal grave!<br />
<br />
Dozens of professions<br />
<br />
Decide whether to specialize in a single profession or instead spread your efforts across many, ranging from crafting, farming, gathering, alchemy, engineering, and many more!</blockquote>
