<div class="message-body">1. Introduction<br />
The originally Guild Wars was sometimes referred to by players as Â“Build WarsÂ” because of the tendency of some matches being decided upon not by player skill level, but by the skills and equipment builds that the players brought into the match. Guild Wars 2 has made great improvements to the game by removing much of the disparity between skill builds of the same profession. However, there is still a strong disparity between builds in the game, and often a players fate in player versus player combat can be decided by their choices in equipment rather than their strategic choices on the field.<br />
2. Problem Statement<br />
Equipment, for the purpose of this post is broken down into four things.<br />
Amulets: The major determiner of stats in PvP. The ammulets hold the majority of stat points that your character will have during pvp. There are several stat combinations on amulets, with certain combinations disallowed for balance reasons.<br />
Gems: The minor determiner of stats in PvP. They have the stat combinations as amulets. However, the stats on them are reduced and you may have up to 5 different gems.<br />
Armor Runes: The item that determine the Â“set bonusÂ” your armor provides. These bonus range in effects from basic stat boosters, buffs, or conditional procs that can occur during combat.<br />
Weapon Sigils: The sigils provide effects that either passively buff your attacks or that trigger effects when you strike a foe, switch weapons, or kill an enemy.<br />
The problem with the equipment in the current PvP environment is that it allows players to leverage their characters too far into certain extremes. The problem generally displays itself in four different ways listed below. However, the root cause is the same; equipment allows too much diversity among professions. The four categories that cause equipment imbalance can generally be broken down into:<br />
Base Statistic Disparity<br />
Lengthening of conditions/buffs to Unacceptable Extremes<br />
Excessively Powerful Buffs to Players<br />
Random Proc Effects that Introduce too Much Unpredictability in Battle<br />
3. Data<br />
3.1. Base Statistic Disparity<br />
Testing for the following was done with an Elementalist with power 2119 striking a Necromancer using Arcane Blast. The toughness value´s listed are the Necromancer´s toughness values throughout the test. Reduction % uses the minimum toughness possible to have on the character as the base.<br />
Toughness___/	__916___/	__1754___/	__2129___/<br />
Damage 1	 2113	 1477	 1252<br />
Damage 2	 2037	 1418	 1365<br />
Damage 3	 2029	 1454	 1269<br />
Damage 4	 2168	 1528	 1261<br />
Damage 5	 2180	 1438	 1354<br />
Average	2105.4	1462.9	1300.2<br />
Table 3.2: Toughness Variance Test<br />
Toughness__/	Damage__/	% Reduction__/<br />
916	2105	0.0%<br />
1754	1463	-30.5%<br />
2129	1300	-38.2%<br />
Table 3.2: Toughness Reduction Summary<br />
Testing for the following was done with an Elementalist with various power and 0 critical damage bonus´s striking the heavy armor dummy in heart of the mist using Arcane blast. Reduction % uses the maximum power possible as the base.<br />
Power_____/	2319__/	1081__/	1919__/<br />
Damage 1	1674	789	1444<br />
Damage 2	1742	812	1373<br />
Damage 3	1767	747	1334<br />
Damage 4	1737	779	1440<br />
Damage 5	1669	820	1430<br />
Average	1717.8	789.4	1404.2<br />
Table 3.3: Power Variance Test<br />
Power____/	Damage__/	Reduction %__/<br />
2129	1718	0.0%<br />
1754	1404	-18.3%<br />
916	789	-54.1%<br />
Table 3.4: Power Reduction Summary<br />
3.2. Lengthening of Conditions/Buffs<br />
For the purposes this bonuses are assumed to be multiplicative in all cases and never additive. I have not tested all combinations to ensure this is the case, but it seems an acceptable assumption to make.<br />
Case 3.1: Stuns Extended<br />
Paralyzing Sigil +15% x2, Mesmer Runes (6) bonus +33% = 75.9% bonus<br />
Stun Duration Base	__1.0	__1.5	__2.0	__2.5	__3.0<br />
Stun Duration Extended	__1.8	__2.6	__3.5	__4.4	__5.3<br />
Table 3.5: Stun Extension<br />
Case 3.2: Confusion Extended<br />
Lyssa Runes (2) 10%, Nightmare Runes (2) 4%, Nightmare Runes (4) 6% = 21.3% bonus or 61.3% w/ Mesmer Trait<br />
Confusion Duration Base	__1.0	__1.5	__2.0	__2.5	__3.0<br />
Confusion Duration Extended	__1.2	__1.8	__2.4	__3.0	__3.6<br />
Mesmer Trait Confusion Extended	__1.6	__2.4	__3.2	__4.0	__4.8<br />
Table 3.6: Confusion Extension<br />
Case 3.3: Burning Extended<br />
Balthazar Runes (2) +15%, Baelfire Runes (2) +15%, Forge Runes (2) +15%, Flame Legion Runes (2) +15%, Smoldering Sigil 10% +10%x2 = 211.6% bonus<br />
Burning Base	__1.0	__2.0	__3.0	__4.0	__5.0<br />
Burning Extended	__2.1	__4.2	__6.3	__8.5	__10.6<br />
Table 3.7: Burning Extension<br />
Case 3.4: Bleeding Increased<br />
Sigil of Earth 60% chance on Crit, 50% crit chance = 30% application.<br />
Necromancer Scepter 1, 2/3 fraction of attacks bleed statistically ? 3/3 fraction of attacks bleed statistically<br />
3.3. Excessively Powerful Buffs and Random Procs that are Overly Unpredictable<br />
Data will not be used to support this. The best way to approach this is build a worst offenders list in my opinion. Since there is already a thread that lists offending Â“RNGÂ” runes, this post will not attribute time to them.<br />
Here is the link to the thread: <a href="http://gw2forum.ncplatform.net/forum/pvp/pvp/Rune-s-Worst-Offenders-in-RNG-Mist-Only/">http://gw2forum.ncplatform.net/forum/pvp/pvp/Rune-s-Worst-Offenders-in-RNG-Mist-Only/</a><br />
4. Personal Conclusions<br />
The reduction range that players can achieve through applying stats, power, toughness, etc. is too high. Players should be able to customize their stat distribution, but not to a point where they can achieve a 50% leverage on both offensive output and defensive incoming.<br />
In my opinion, the game has a significant amount of complexity. Adding proper amulet choice to the decision pool does not improve the situation. Amulet count should be reduced; possibly even to one amulet that provides a base level of stats. Players should then leverage their stats in a minor fashion using traits and gems. This would keep player damage more consistent while still allowing some leverage to players.<br />
Runes that increase boon and condition durations should be removed. These effects prevent skills from being properly balanced inherent of themselves. Rather skills are balanced against the items that are possible with them. A 3 second concussion blow on warrior may not be inherently overpowered. However, a 5.3 second stun is quite overpowered and the runes prevent a 3 second stun from existing in the game out of fear that players will leverage the effect to this extreme.<br />
In addition, this does not hold true for only stuns. Any skill that can be extended through equipment will always be balanced against its extended nature and not its inherent base which limits its use outside of extreme leveraged cases.<br />
P.S. The way Textile on these forums handles table setup is atrocious. It is almost impossible to present data in an easily readable way.</div>
