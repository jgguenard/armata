<div class="message-body">Current Patch Notes: 1/30/11 Build 26-1-B<br />
Build 26-1-B<br />
1/30/2011<br />
<br />
<br />
=== FEATURED ===<br />
* Racial Abilities revamped; see below under their special notes section!<br />
* We are testing the delivery system for preorder and CE rewards which means you'll be able to get them on Alpha!<br />
<br />
<br />
GENERAL GAMEPLAY<br />
* WE ARE TESTING THIS DELIVERY SYSTEM. Not all rewards may be hooked up yet. Preorder and Collector's Edition rewards are now available if your Alpha account has these entitlements. Obtaining them in Alpha DOES NOT count against your rewards at release. Check your characters' mail!<br />
* We have removed the level requirement for equipment rewards granted by quests. All quest rewards will now be bound by the wider level range required to obtain the quest itself. If you can complete it, the gear will be usable.<br />
* Cash on Delivery mail is now available for use. CoD mail marked as Spam is returned to sender. You also cannot delete CoD mail if the item is still attached.<br />
* Very large NPCs are now easier to loot and butcher.<br />
* A first pass of Master Looting is now available. An icon on the raidframe show who the master looter is. The leader can right click someone from the raidframe to make them master looter when the raid is in that loot mode. They can also use /setmasterlooter, which will work on their target or a supplied name.<br />
* Quest achievements for zones should count up properly again. The triggers for these will be re-run on login so we can correct characters with incorrect counts.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
HIGH ELVES<br />
* Removed Wisdom of the Ages.<br />

* Increased the number of Footholds to destroy for achievements from 10 to 100 per planar type.[hr]<br />
RIFT CURRENCY<br />
* Completing zone events and Major Rifts drop a unified form of currency across the following zones. Planar Goods merchants in those zones all accept that unified currency.<br />
* Note: Some of these zones (post-Scarwood) still have Planar Goods merchants on vacation pending item revision.<br />

<br />
DROUGHTLANDS<br />

<br />

* Potions cannot be runebroken at this time.<br />
* Runecrafting: Epic, Rare, and Uncommon Crystals can now be broken back down into powders.<br />
* Fixed a bug where low level crafting quest reward bags were awarding Ancient Dragonbone. They should actually award Tin Bars now... whoops.<br />
* Recipes will no longer display as green when they can no longer increase your crafting skill.<br />
* Fixed an issue where clicking on a resource tracking ability twice would randomly remove one other active tracking ability. Now these buffs can only be removed by right-clicking the buff icons.<br />

* Updated offhand runes to require a Totem or Shield. The exception are Thwarting Runes, which are Shield-only. Updated block values for Thwarting Runes, which are now considerably higher.<br />

<br />
<br />
UI/SETTINGS<br />
* The Collections panel has been merged into the new Character Sheet.<br />
* The 'Show Collections' button in the lower left icon tray has been replaced with a 'Show Crafting' button now that Collections are part of the character sheet UI.<br />
* Added Block Absorption amount to the tooltip for Block in the Character Sheet.<br />
* Stealth ability buttons will work like a toggle now; pressing them a second time will cancel stealth.<br />
* Purchasing a stack of an item from a merchant will now display the purchase stack window allowing you to select how many items you wish to buy.<br />
* Video Settings: Removed the 4x SSAA option due to performance issues on even the beefiest of machines. 2x SSAA selection now has a warning about the high-end graphic card needs for this setting and framerate decreases it will cause.<br />
* Video Settings: Merged shadow options into one dropdown.<br />
<br />
<br />
CLIENT/SERVER<br />
* Improved client performance in VFX-heavy situations.<br />
* Added error detection for corrupt game data. You will now get a warning and helpful suggestion to use the Recover option in the patcher if it detects a problem.<br />
* Added progress text to the upper left corner of the loading screen to help diagnose some users who are unable to load into the game.<br />
* Fixed an issue that caused some people to freeze on the loading screen for excessive amounts of time, and then suffer extremely low framerates when finally in game.<br />
* Addressed some performance issues that should improve game experience for users with ATI cards.<br />

hahaha !<br />
<br />
J'ai pas l'intention de jouer sur un coté ou ca prend un eternité a faire des warfront. Ca fait longtemps que je le dit : On regarde toujours pour savoir quelles guilds vont ou et kel faction, mais les info sont tres tres minible. Le monde attendais le revamp des racial skills... Apres le prochain beta j'ai l'impression qu'on va pouvoir deja voir une ligne etablie de qui va ou, sinon ca va allez au dernier beta... Soyon patient pour pas se faire avoir :P</div>

<div class="message-body">      Les guardian sont en désavantage numérique, c'est pour ça que les scénarios pop au minute. Comme je l'ai dis il est mieux pour nous de choisir un côté moins fréquenté et avoir plus de cibles à tuer que d'en tuer un en 1 heure de roamming.<br />
<br />
Pour les races, ils sont plus équilibrées, mais peut-être pas aussi inutile que ça, mais comme Asakra dit, tu te monteras pas un mage avec une race qui te donnera un bonus en dex. :P<br />
