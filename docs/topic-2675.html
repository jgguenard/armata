<div class="message-body">Pour ceux qui n'ont pas accès ou le temps d'aller sur le site de l'alliance, voici un post qui résume l'ABC du WvWvW :<br />

<blockquote>
<cite>Khaos wrote:</cite>
The purpose of this thread is to lay out everything for those who didn't get much time in WvW in Beta, or for those that didn't understand the complexity of WvW.  I'm going to reiterate the obvious points and then go into detail further down.<br />
<br />
WvW is a 2 week long battle between 3 servers to control the most points on the map.  The three outer (home) worlds are the same geographically, while Eternal Battlegrounds in the middle has the same amount of points in each third of the map, but the geography is different.<br />
<br />
Points (tallied every 5 minutes):<br />
<br />
Supply Camps: 5<br />
Towers: 10<br />
Keeps: 25<br />
Stone Mist: 50<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>Supply Camps:</b><br />
<br />
Supply camps truly are the life blood of WvW.  Without supply towers, keeps and Stonemist will fall given enough time, regardless of the number of defenders.  Supply camps are also the easiest points on the map to take, a group of 5 can take a supply camp relatively quickly if the NPC guards are all that are present.  Once controlled, there are regular intervals in which 2 dolyaks are sent towards towers, keeps and stonemist.  On top of this players can carry up to 10 supply on them from the depot.  There are multiple upgrades for supply camps, and the two that should be bought in the secure supply camps are:<br />
<br />
Hire Guards- hires npc guards to escort dolyaks.  This is necessary because without them players are forced to guard dolyaks from npc monsters that constantly attack the caravans.<br />
Increase Supply:  This upgrade increases the amount of supply delivered from Dolyaks.  This is a must since supply is crucial to defending towers, keeps and SM.<br />
<br />
<b>Towers:</b><br />
<br />
Towers are worth 10 points.  While they are not as important as keeps (yes Fire I said it!) they provide LoS over areas, and a defensible position from roaming groups.  Towers have one ring of walls and 1 gate.  They hold 100 supply and they can have both personnel and structure upgrades.  Towers are immediately adjacent to Supply Camps on the map and are useful for control over these areas.  I will detail the list of upgrades after describing Keeps and Stonemist.<br />
<br />
<b>Keeps:</b><br />
<br />
Keeps are worth 25 points.  They are very easy to defend and consist of 2 rings of walls and 2 gates.  Keeps can hold around 500 supply w/o upgrades.  Keeps typically provide the most control over the surrounding area and can be a bear to assault.  On Eternal Battlegrounds, there is a keep directly in front of each worlds entrance to the map.  This is the Back of the keep, and it has only one wall between there and the Keep Lord.  While there is only one wall, there are two gates back to back at this rear entrance, see the pics for a visualization.  Every keep in the Home Worlds and EB has some type of secret entrance that is typically a less defended way into the 2nd level.<br />

<br />
<b>Stonemist:</b><br />
<br />
The Epitome of Power, Prestige, and Defense, Stonemist castle will be our (TBH's) focus at the beginning of every new match up in WvW.  It is easily the most defensible position on any of the maps, it has 2 rings of walls, 2 sets of gates, and 3 levels.  The Keep within the castle provides a third level for defensive equipment, and the Castle lord is extremely hard to kill if well-defended by players.  Stonemist holds 1,200 supply without upgrades, and it provides control over the immediate surroundings.  Hours can be spent besieging Stonemist with no progress made.  We want to take Stonemist and upgrade it from the outset of every two week period.  This will be our Bi-weekly consistent raid, where we will request everyone to come out for the first 3 hours of these match-ups.  We will immediately split up and take the first two supply camps, everyone will grab supply and then we will all rush to Stonemist.  When it is neutral there are no gates, we will only be contested by other worlds to defeat the Keep Lord.  We will need as many Brothers as possible in this endeavor so that we are guaranteed the option to claim Stonemist as our own.<br />
<br />
Please note, at the moment when server match-ups reset supply stays with the characters.  Stock up before the reset so your entire raid can lay down siege weapons at contested match-ups (i.e. Stonemist) early on.<br />
<br />

<b>Notes about Tower/Keep/Castle Defense:</b><br />
<br />
- It is possible to repair damaged gates and walls.  Go to the supply depot and grab supply, walk to the damage structure and hit F<br />
- It is possible to do damage through gates with melee weapons.  For example a warrior can hit enemies meleeing the gate on the outside if he melees from the inside.  Note this goes both ways, they can damage you as well.<br />
