Herald Gaurath<br />
<br />
Health: 3,369,585<br />
<br />
Abilities:<br />
Breath of the Void: Frontal cone. Deals ~3.5k Death damage per second for 4 seconds. Used every ~30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Crushing Tail Swipe: Hits raid members for ~5-8k damage. Does not actually do it on his tail if you are within his hitbox. Very buggy.<br />
<br />

<br />
Miasma of Suffering: Breath attack used at the start of every air phase. Deals ~1.3k Death damage per second for 5 seconds. Deals damage beneath and in front of Gaurath.<br />
<br />
Tidings of Woe: Emotes and marks a random raid member (can mark Tanks #2, and #3). Either 12 people (pets included) must stack on them and all take ~2.8k damage, or they must stand by themselves, and die.<br />
<br />
Raise Dead: Gaurath uses this ability every ~1m10s. This spawns the Bladed and Foul Icons.<br />
<br />
Adds Spawned:<br />
Foul Icon: Green Obelisk that spawns right before the adds. These spawn the Ancient Defilers and do not need to be DPSd.<br />
<br />
Bladed Icon: Red obelisk that spawns right before the adds. These spawn the Ancient Cuthroat and Ancient Executioner and do not need to be DPSd.<br />
<br />
Ancient Executioner<br />
Health: 230,671<br />
Abilities:<br />
Voidbound Rage: Cast on self. Makes each melee attack hit for ~900 extra Death Damage.<br />
Void Curse: Cast on the tank. Deals ~1k Death damage. Makes the target recieve 100% extra damage from Herald Gauraths attacks. Tank #1 must never get this.<br />
Impending Doom: At around 8% health the mob becomes immune and explodes for ~2.8k Death damage on 12 raid members (includes pets). The raid must be stacked for this ability.<br />
<br />

Abilities:<br />
Voidbound Rage: Cast on self. Makes each melee attack hit for ~900 extra Death Damage.<br />
Void Curse: Cast on the tank. Deals ~1k Death damage. Makes the target recieve 100% extra damage from Herald Gauraths attacks. Tank #1 must never get this.<br />
Impending Doom: At around 8% health the mob becomes immune and explodes for ~2.8k Death damage on 12 raid members (includes pets). The raid must be stacked for this ability.<br />
<br />

<br />
Indomitable Horror<br />
Health: 177,440<br />
Abilites:<br />
Void Curse: Cast on the tank. Deals ~1k Death damage. Makes the target recieve 100% extra damage from Herald Gauraths attacks. Tank #1 must never get this.<br />
Impending Doom: At around 8% health the mob becomes immune and explodes for ~2.8k Death damage on 12 raid members (includes pets). The raid must be stacked for this ability.<br />
<br />
Icon of the Herald:<br />
One is spawned every air phase. It is essentially a giant void zone.<br />
Abilities:<br />
Aura of the Void: Deals ~1500 Death damage per tick. Must be run out of. Positioning of these is imperative to the fight.<br />
<br />
Tank Damage: Very high on both Tank#1, and Tank#2. Tank#3 takes a low amount of damage as he is only tanking the Imdomitable Horrors.<br />
<br />
Raid Damage: Extremely High, especially during air phases.<br />
<br />
Strategy:<br />
Tank #1 will being the pull by moving Gaurath slightly north to give the raid more room. The raid will stack on the west side of Gaurath, at max melee range.<br />
<br />
On the first set of adds, the raid will move south, and let Tank #2 pickup all of the adds. He will stack them on top of Gaurath, and the raid will collapse behind them.<br />
<br />
There should be two raid members assigend to each Ancient Defiler to interrupt Defiling Storm. Adds will be marked as follows:<br />
Ancient Defiler: 1<br />
Ancient Defiler: 2<br />
Ancient Cutthroat: 3<br />
Ancient Executioner: 4<br />
<br />
The DPS will proceed to kill 1 first, allowing the raid to be healed, then killing 2. Once 2 is dead, everyone will begin AoE´ing. Once all adds are dead, DPS will switch to the boss.<br />
<br />
~1m10s after the first set of adds, he will use Raise dead a second time and become airborne. He will then use Miasma of Suffering, preceded by Tidings of Woe, then summoning the Icon of the Herald. He will land after ~13 seconds.<br />
<br />
When he becomes airborne, the tank must move far to the North so that Herald repositions himself when he lands. The Ranged will move to the Northwest or Northeast and the melee will remain stacked on the adds with the tank to maintain interrupts. This is the most challenging part of the fight. Master this, and you will down the boss.<br />
<br />
When he lands, he will spawn an Imdomitable Horror. Tank#3 must pick this up and tank it slightly behind the raid (does not cleave). There is no need to kill this add, as it has a reduced incoming damage buff, and hits for near nothing. Tank#2 will reposition himself on the side of Gaurath with the raid stacking behind them. At this point the fight becomes rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Suggested Raid Composition:<br />
3 Tanks, Tank#1 on Herald Gaurath, Tank#2 on all Ancient Adds, Tank #3 on Indomitable Horrors<br />
2 Warden/Sentinel, 1 on Tank#2, 1 on Tank #3<br />
2 Purifier/Sentinel, 1 on Tank #1, 1 on Tank #2<br />
1 Justicar/Inquistor for raid heals<br />
2 Chloromancers, 1 synth on Tank#1, 1 Synth on Tank#2<br />
1 Bard<br />
1 Archon<br />
8 DPS </div>

on le down a soir![hr]<br />
Ok so this fight we barely saw anything. The things we know:<br />
<br />
Dragon Boss:<br />
-Frontal Cleave<br />
-Frontal Breath<br />
-NO tail swipe<br />
-Flies Up<br />
<br />
[hr]<br />
Boss Abilities:<br />
Frontal Cleave<br />
Frontal Breath<br />
Tailswipe - note: weird behavior, not quite clear how it behaves.<br />
<br />
3 tanks<br />
1 - Main boss<br />
2 - Stone adds<br />
3 - Big mob from the Air phase<br />
<br />
Ground Phase<br />
Stack on right back leg and the marked person.<br />
Stones are put down on random raid members. The raid simply side steps as adds will spawn from the stones. The raid re-stacks on the back right leg as the tank picks up the adds. Two are casters that HAVE to be interrupted. Single target DPS the marked target, switching off to the next target at around 25%. The adds explode for significant aoe damage, so need to be killed strictly one at a time or people die.<br />
<br />
Air Phase<br />
Stack on the marked person.<br />
He will lift off and get into a position to do a deep breath type mechanic. It will be in a cone in front of him. It has to be avoided by everyone. Stones with the accompanying adds will spawn, as well as another &quot;big&quot; add that spawns on top of the main boss tank needs to be picked up by the 3rd tank. This add is off tanked as it has 99% damage reduction. The boss will mark 1 player with a meteor type ability that expires in 3-5 seconds, if not enough people are around it the person to soak and split the damage, the person will die. There is also another stone that gets put down that does a pulsating ~30 meter aoe around its center. This gets places on a person as well.<br />
<br />
The strategy for this phase is to keep stacked and move to the edge of the room, once the pulsating stone goes out, the entire raid moves out of the aoe and repositions. At this time the boss will land and continue in the ground phase.<br />
<br />
The fight is rinse and repeat, the only change is the addition of an extra &quot;big&quot; add for the 3rd tank to handle with each addition air phase.<br />

<div class="message-body">Air Phase Summary:<br />
Alsbeth flies up and become immune.<br />
Defiled Guardians or Defiants may still be active.<br />
Discordant Energy spawn<br />
Pillar(s) will spawn<br />
A Thief, Magus, and/or Harbringer will spawn.<br />
Once all Pillars and adds are killed, Alsbeth will land.<br />
Things to do:<br />
Stack of the Meteor target if you are in range.<br />
Each of the three tanks need to pick up the Thief/Magus/Harbringer when Alsbeth takes off.<br />
The Tank with the Guardian/Defiant adds will need to collect them and the Harbringer and bring them to a common area for AOE dps.<br />
Magus´ Soul Destruction must be interrupted.<br />
Wracked Soul target needs to keep moving.<br />
Kill Wisps.<br />
Grab crystals and bring them to pillars.<br />
Stay spread out due to Chains of Discord if a Magus is alive<br />
Make sure you group up the wisps and left over Defiled Guardians and Defiants so they die to AOE dps.<br />
This cycle will continue until Alsbeth is 20% health.<br />
At 20%, Alsbeth will regenerate her health and a large amount of wisps will spawn. Gather them and kill them. As they die crystals will spawn at the towers again. Grab them and run them into Alsbeth. They will do ~7% damage to her. She also has a damage shield that will instantly kill you if it´s up and you run a crystal into her.<br />
All of Alsbeth´s damaging abilities are active during this phase, including a ground based AOE attack. Kill wisps, collect crystals and run them to Alsbeth. This last phase isn´t very difficult.<br />
