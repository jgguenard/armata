<br />
=== KNOWN ISSUES ===<br />
* Reactive Abilities UI is on temporary vacation. That jerk.<br />
* Granting of the Collector's Edition Satchel has been temporarily disabled.<br />
* The Soul of the Pyromancer is giving a soul sigil not needed for the quest. Just ignore it!<br />
<br />
<br />
GENERAL GAMEPLAY<br />
* You can no longer return mail to sender if it was generated by an NPC or the game system.<br />
* Level requirements have been removed from the previously-level 20 mount. If you can get to them, and can afford them, you can use them.<br />
* We now show a warning if you roll on loot while your inventory is full.<br />
* If the winner of a loot roll has no inventory space, the item stays on the corpse but is only lootable by the winner.<br />
* You can now roll need/greed on loot while dead, even if the Soul Walk/respawn option is on screen.<br />
* Quest counting achievements really should be updating now. For real.<br />
* The Archon soul quest can once again be completed.<br />
<br />
<br />
COMBAT<br />
* Fixed an issue causing some pets to behave incorrectly. This fix will reset pet settings (passive/defensive etc, what abilities are toggled on) to the defaults.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOULS<br />
<br />
ASSASSIN<br />
* Serrated Blades: Fixed tooltip error.<br />
<br />
BARD<br />
* Verse of Captivation: Fixed tooltip to indicate the affect only works on a single enemy.<br />
<br />
RANGER<br />
* Prey of the Weak: Damage bonus reduced to 5-15%, down from 10-30%. The duration has been extended from 10 seconds to 20 seconds.<br />
* Piercing Shot: Damage slightly increased.<br />
* Shadow Fire: Duration of the haste buff increased to 15 seconds from 10.<br />
* Dire Wolf, Blood Raptor: Ability damage slightly reduced for these pets.<br />
<br />
SABOTEUR<br />
* Carpet Bombing: Now also resets the cooldown of your Bombs.<br />
* Spike Charge, Blast Charge: Damage has been very slightly reduced!<br />
* Charges, Bombs, and Detonate can now be used with any weapon equipped.<br />
* New Ability - Incriminate: 20 point root ability. When activated, all threat generated is transferred to the target party or raid member for 6 seconds. Does not trigger global cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
DUNGEONS AND RAIDS<br />
* Melee damage of most dungeon bosses has been reduced.<br />
* Messages showing people joining/leaving a raid group now go to the General tab.<br />
* Hunger of the Deep Rift Raid adjustments based on feedback and playtests.<br />
<br />
<br />
ITEMS<br />
* Preorder Runes can now be applied to two-handed Swords and Staves.<br />
* Fixed an issue keeping many of the new Greater Essences from attaching their spell effect.<br />
* Foci-equipped Greater Essences did actually get removed with the previous patch, you're not crazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
PVP/WARFRONTS<br />
* If you are under the leaving-PvP flag timer when you log out, the countdown no longer resets when you log back in.<br />
* Power-ups in Warfronts no longer persist once you leave the map.<br />
* Engaging in PvP in protected areas can catch the attention of peacekeeping Guards! You'll still need to be in range of them to get their aggro, though.<br />
* Player-summoned Guardian and Defiant invasions will no longer cause you to get PvP-flagged if attacked.<br />
<br />
GRAPHICS AND AUDIO<br />
* Fixed visual effects sometimes being left floating in the world.<br />
* Updated body animations to prevent legs moving independently of upper body animations.<br />
* Mighty Leap and Angelic Flight will now animate correctly the first time they are used.<br />
* Improved character model AA.<br />
* Fixed a bug causing characters to not appear correctly in the portrait windows.<br />
<br />
<br />
UI/SETTINGS<br />
* You can now toggle between display of server time and local time by left clicking the clock below the minimap.<br />
* Changing the clock time also updates your chat timestamps to the appropriate time selection.<br />
* Fixed an AA warning popping up when changing unrelated settings.<br />
* Target of Target portrait should no longer get into a state where it displays 0/0 and negative percent.<br />
* Special characters will once again display properly in the chat window when using copy/paste and slash commands.<br />
<br />
<br />
CLIENT/SERVER<br />
* Fixed client to properly persist the maximized window state.<br />
* Added a message if the client can't connect to the game servers on the standard ports (6900-6909), but CAN connect successfully on port 80. This case suggests that the required ports are blocked and that the user should contact Customer Service for troubleshooting.<br />
