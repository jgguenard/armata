Greenscale's Blight is now set to be a 20-player raid dungeon instead of 10-man.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so a little sum up of what we found out during our first clear(or well up to last boss).<br />
<br />
First boss is pretty cool concept wise, you just want to fix him so his buff isn't purgable. Currently, you can ignore the whole slow+kiting issue thingie since you can just remove his dmg increase buff with any purge. I also assume they're not supposed to be killed, but the flying faeries can't be meleed by pets. Maybe by players too not sure. Not a big concern though. It'd also be nice if the ground slow goo thingie had an actual visible graphic, or if it does, make sure it's apparent on all configs. I couldn't see it on ultra or high at least. I feel it's well balanced too, a really cool introductionary fight.<br />
<br />
Second boss we fought was the oracle(not infiltrator like the quest implies). She felt really weak. The first phase mechanics are cool even though I'm not entirely sure if the wolf who targets someone is supposed to be this slow? He was on me and I had time to cast actual nukes on him, when I'm pretty sure I should have been running the whole time instead. Might want to look into the speed factors here(might have been because of bard song, make the link debuff he cast remove all movement buffs, would make it more fun). Second phase was a tank and spank basically, the buff she got didn't seem to buff her dmg all that much. Also one thing that probably wasn't intended, you can purge her alternate form buff(not the stacking yellow buff, just the other one she gets at the start of phase2). Not sure that buff did anything but if it did, yeah, make it unpurgable.<br />
<br />
3rd boss was infiltrator whatever, really cool fight, but one big problem(that's a recurring problem with raids in this game imo) is the flash bombs or whatever were sometimes not visible at all, like if you stand too far or with a wrong camera angle. Complicated the fight a lot. Other than that, real cool fight, cool mechanics, loved it. Just make sure the flash bombs draw properly since it's frustrating otherwise.<br />
<br />
Prince Hylas was pretty easy. During one of his phase, he spawns a purplish cloud thingie, that could use a lifting to make it more visible, currently it's really tough to notice it. Also the wolves follow very weird pathing at times, so they come out of the walls and stuff(happened a bit with the trash in the maze too). I believe his last phase buff is broken though, it keeps stacking, but I didn't really notice a DPS increase. That or it's very small, he was at like 14charges at the end and the tank wasn't taking a lot of dmg, nor was I doing a lot. Again, cool fight, love the phase transition stuff, really awesome.<br />
<br />
Last boss, seemed overtuned and/or buggy. Plants weren't dying all the time(like had someone stand on a plant with the debuff for 10secs, or at some point a plant spawned on our tank who was standing in the pool), boss was 2shotting our tanks even without the debuff, plants debuff does absurd amounts of damage and are unavoidable when they spawn it seemed. We didn't get many tries in cause it was getting late, but the tank damage seemed to be simply too high anyway. He was crushing our tanks literally.<br />
<br />
Anyway one recurrent issue with raids and experts, many effects just aren't visible enough. I understand they need to look realistic, like poisonous mist or whatever, but it's extremely annoying when you can't tell the boundaries of an AE, or can't see them in certain angles. Example would be that purple mist one that you use in Prince Hylas, the 2nd boss in Fae or the expert life rift in Stillmoor on the last boss. Half the time it doesn't draw, and the other half it's so subtle you really need to look for it to notice it, which I find is kinda bad(doesn't help on all these fights the ground is dark green). I'm not asking for it to be fluorescent, but it could be made a little more visible by making it brighter in color for example(so it creates a contrast with the dark ground).<br />
<br />
One last thing, it's very hard to tell how well tuned these encounters are when warriors are doing 1300DPS, rogues 900DPS, mages 600DPS and clerics don't even make the top10. Currently anything DPS based can be trivialized by having more than 3DPS warriors, simply because they're worth 2DPS. At some point if you want to fine tune encounters, you're gonna have to start balancing DPS classes between callings, not just between souls in a particular calling.<br />

Comments on Greenscale's Blight<br />
1.Duke needs to not be purge-able. Needs model size increased.<br />
2.Oracle is a joke, I thought the walls would make us get behind them to avoid some huge AE or something, but there's nothing special about this fight. Needs model size increased.<br />
3.Infiltrator is good and once you normalize DPS between classes will be great. Needs model size increased.<br />
4.Prince is meh, I like the mechanics, but he's a pushover. The adds should be harder to kill and be more difficult. Needs model size increased.<br />
5.Greenscale is holy ****. He's super difficult, looks like some overtune, or we're retarded. We'll revisit.<br />
