<div class="message-body">This was a patch to mainly address the crosshair wobble system we were using so far. After tester feedback on how this wasn't working for them, we redesigned the functionality and implemented it.<br />
<br />
Update: We've added a &quot;Sell 10 Wood to Vendor&quot; feat, that rewards you with 50.000 Prowess Points, for testing end-game PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changes / Additions:<br />
<br />
A new crosshair wobble system is now in place. The longer you hold your arrow or spell, the more accuracy you gain. Skirmishers have an accuracy bonus (shorter time required to full accuracy) when using their bows, while Elementalists and Primalists have the same bonus when using their staves.<br />
<br />
<br />
Teleport skills (House recall, Bindstone Recall, Runestone using, Summon friend) are no longer available while in a dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changed the HUD fadeout to only fadeout the target-related visual components<br />
<br />
<br />
Reduced the radius of the safe areas.<br />
<br />
<br />
Added a visual indicator in the map for the safe areas that can be toggled on/off from the map filters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changed it so when a player successfully salvages an item, the resources they receive will be added to their inventory in the same location/bag that the salvaged item was removed from; be it the inventory root, a bag, a Â“salvage bagÂ” or a bag within a Â“salvage bagÂ”<br />
<br />
<br />
New sounds for casting Deadeye school abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
New sounds for Player Weapons Sheathe/Unsheathe<br />
<br />
<br />
New sounds for Primalist Spells<br />
<br />
<br />
New sounds for On Screen Messaging<br />
<br />
<br />
New Earthquake Monster Spell<br />
<br />
<br />
Changed descriptions of Spirit Bond and Wall of righteous force<br />
<br />
<br />
Changed description of treasure maps<br />
<br />
<br />
Changed descriptions of all attributes<br />
<br />
