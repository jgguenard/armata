<br />
Abilities:<br />
<br />
Thunder Clap: Used every 5-10 seconds. Hits for ~4k, destroys nearby Galvanic Focuses.<br />
<br />
Shocking Cipher: Used every ~20 seconds. Chains off one person and hits nearby raid members for 75% of their health.<br />
<br />

<br />
Walking Sleep: Used every ~30 seconds. Does 800 damage a tick and fears for 5 seconds. Cleanseable.<br />
<br />
Void Overload: Used every ~60 seconds. Puts a shield on Plutonus and channels 3-4k damage per tick on the tank. Must be DPS´d through.<br />
<br />
Demolishing Wave: Used when Plutonus hits 100% energy. Wipes the raid.<br />
<br />
Forceful Gaze: Used on the tank if they get out of range of Plutonus. Can be dangerous as he will pull the tank behind him and spin around. This can result in the raid getting Thunder Clapped. Deals 2.4k damage.<br />
<br />
Tank Damage:<br />
High spikes during Shocking Cipher. or Destroy Artifact. Tank can get instagibbed by Shocking Cipher, and Thunderclap, if used at the same time.<br />
<br />
Raid Damage:<br />
High spikes, but otherwise low.<br />
<br />
Strategy:<br />
This is a pure DPS race, with very little the raid has to pay attention to. Plutonus´ energy bar must be managed by the Tank and one other player throughout the fight. Everyone must be within the hexagon, or they will become locked out.<br />
<br />
The fight starts with Plutonus spawning lightning beams from the 6 Galvanic Focus´ around the room. These lightning beams will more or less one shot any DPS/Healer that wanders into them. They despawn whenever their corresponding Focus is destroyed.<br />

Focus' are targetable, but they are to be killed by Plutonus. When he reaches 50% Energy, the tank must wait for a Shocking Cipher to go off. After it does, and the raid is healed back to full, he must drag Plutonus to a Galvanic Focus. When Plutonus next uses Thunder Clap, he will destroy the Focus. This will result in Destroy Artifact damage hitting the whole raid.<br />
<br />
The tank will then pull Plutonus near the next Focus, and have him destroy it when he reaches ~60% energy.<br />
<br />
It is recommended you do this 3 times. Once three have been destroyed, the tank will pull Plutonus to the center, and the raid will stack up behind him. At 50% health Plutonus will spawn a laser wall that lines the outer rim of the area.<br />
<br />
The first shape it forms is a hexagon.<br />

<br />
At 40% health it will become a trapezoid.<br />

At 30% health, it will become a rectangle.<br />

At 20% health, it will become a triangle.<br />

The triangle is the last shape, and it will slowly shrink on the raid from the north point starting at 10%. The east and west points do not converge. You have 30 seconds to kill him before the triangle shrinks completely.<br />
<br />
During this time one raid member will be using Unstable Crystals to sap Plutonis energy. Each crystal drains 10% of his energy, and hits the user for roughly 11k damage over 3 seconds. This person requires a dedicated healer during this phase.<br />
<br />
All other raid members should be unloading as much DPS as possible onto Plutonis.<br />
