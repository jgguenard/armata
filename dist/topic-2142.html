After many iterations now, this question pops up again:<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000">How do loot tables work?<br />
and<br />
How does Magic Find work?</span>[size=large][/size]I´ll try to explain my understanding and pose a few questions on the specific mechanics.<br />
Disclaimer: Everything in here is pure theorycrafting on my accord, based on different games and previous discussions. All values are only chosen to help demonstrate the examples.<br />
Loot Tables<br />
Now, as far as I´ve gathered from previous discussions and from other games including Diablo III the mechanics work as following:<br />
First the game checks if you are going to receive an item. Sometimes this guaranteed such as with chests, otherwise it´s random like you´d have with mobs. Mobs that spawn infinitely such as you´ll find at the start of the Ascalon Catacombs Explorables have their drops disabled to counter farming, also critters.<br />
Question 1: What is the participation requirement for a drop<br />
and does the amount of participation affect the chance of a drop?<br />
Question 2: How does a monster´s rank affect the number and chance of drops?<br />
If an item will drop there is a series of choices that need to be determined. Step by step each property of the item is chosen. For example the first roll would be the type of item: Equipment or Materials. For example:<br />
Equipment 40% chance, Materials 30% chance, Junk 30% chance<br />
In order, a roll is made on equipment. A failure creates a second roll in this table for materials. A second failure here will default to generating junk.<br />
Linsey Murdock said:<br />
Any time you roll positive to try for a dye, it rolls again and if you fail that roll, you get Dandelions. So every time you see a Dandelion, that could have been a dye. It is the only way we could get the dye unlocks to the rarity that we wanted them to be with the system being the way it is.<br />
Kind of like 4 Piles of Glittering Dust in Underworld and Fissure of Woe in GW1, that could have been an Ecto or an Obs shard.<br />
Each time a choice from one table is determined the next is pulled up and the next property is rolled for. More realistic tables would look like:<br />
Initial: [Special, Armor, Weapon, Crafting Material, Trophy, Coins, Junk]<br />
Armor: [Chest, Legs, Helm, Shoulder, Gloves, Boots, Trinket]<br />
Skin: [World type 1, type 2, .. Zone type 1, type 2, .., Creature type 1, type 2, .. ]<br />
HasUpgrade: [Yes, No]<br />
Upgrade: [sigil/rune 1, sigil/rune 2, ..]<br />
Now all that´s left to be determined are the attributes: level, attribute set and rarity. The interesting part here is the rarity roll, as it starts by rolling the highest valued items first:<br />
_	___Type_____	_Chance____<br />
Legendary	 1/1000000<br />
Exotic	 1/1000<br />
Rare	 1/100<br />
Masterwork	 1/10<br />
Fine	 1/2<br />
Basic	 rest<br />
.<br />
Many of these tables are rolled in parallel. The order in which these items are rolled is very important in our next chapter on Magic Find.<br />
Question 3: What loot tables are there exactly and what order are they in?<br />
Question 4: How does a mob´s rank affect the quality of drops?<br />
Magic Find<br />
Each player has a base percentage of 100% magic find which acts as a multiplier of 1 toward each roll. Magic Find can be increased trough specific equipment, upgrade components, food and buffs.<br />
For example you equip an Explorer´s Chestpiece of the Traveler with +3% (Explorer) and +7% (Rune) and eat Strawberries and Biscuits giving you an extra +10%. Your new magic find is now 120%.<br />
With nearly every roll in the loot table this multiplier is applied on the roll. If you would have 200% magic find an item with a chance of 1/1000000 would increase to 2/1000000. Because the rarest item is rolled first the relative chance of each tier stays the same, but you´d have a skewed increase in each chance in favor of the first items.<br />
Item A has 10% chance, item B has 20% chance. Because each roll is executed in sequence and dependent on the previous the global chance of rolling item A is 10%, but for item B it´s 0.90 * 0.20 = 18% chance.<br />
Now we apply a magic find multiplier of 2 by equipping an extra 100% MF. Item A : 20%, Item B : 40%. Global chances still are the same for our first item in the row, but the second item becomes 0.80 * 0.40 = 32% chance. Instead of a 100% increase we now see an increase of 77% toward the global chance of item B.<br />
Question 5: What tables does this multiplier apply to? In other words what does magic find actually affect besides just item rarity?<br />
Examples: Drop chance, # of drops, item type, skin rarity, upgrade component chance, critical gathering chance.<br />
Another really important thing to note is that, because Magic Find is based on percentages you have diminishing returns: every extra MF you apply will be less efficient than the previous.<br />
Say you carry +90% MF for a total of 190%. If you want to double your magic find, a 380% total, it will require an extra +280% MF! It´s easy to forget the base 100%.<br />
Eventually Magic Find boils down to : how much are you willing to sacrifice to improve your drops? Keep in mind that less damage also means killing mobs slower.<br />
