<div class="message-body">Paladin Review - Post 1/27/2011 Patch<br />
Quick run down on the adjustments from the 1/27/2011 Patch for the paladin.<br />
<br />
***Talents***<br />
<br />
- Aggressive Guardian: Threat decreased by 10% and lowered to a Tier 2 ability. No real issues here as most tank builds are already sturdy in the hate department.<br />
<br />
- Shield of the Hero: Currently bugged and not updating the character sheet accurately. The minus in hit chance I'm not so sure as to why making raids are becoming more available.<br />
<br />
- Graceful Under Pressure: Would prefer 5/10/15% with the nerf to Shield of the Hero. Also should switch places with Steely Resolve.<br />
<br />
- Unyielding Defense: Great talent by theory, questionable by implementation. Going off of pre-patch values, the warrior block mitigation was 40%, by tooltip (&quot;Blocks mitigation an EXTRA 20% damage&quot;), you toss up either we will block 60% damage or 20% more of the 40% to 48%. Right now we are getting neither. Currently with this ability at max rank, we are only getting 38% block mitigation which leads many to think either our base block mitigation value was reduced, or block is bugged completely. Need developer clarification here.<br />
<br />
- Reverent Protection: Look devs, I know you guys hate me, but I have to call you out on this again. Pre-patch this talent A - Didn't work, B - was a 1331 damage rune for 30s on a 3 minute cooldown. Post-patch, this ability A - works B - STILL has low damage of 1528 with the +20% increase talent while STILL being on a 3 minute cooldown. This ability is still flatout USELESS. Last night I ran expert IT just to see how mobs hit now, this ability last literally less than 1 second on the tank, LESS THAN ONE SECOND. Bad bad bad talent that needs help.<br />
<br />
- Improved Reverent Protection: Good step in the right direction. It needs to increase the damage by much more than 10/20% however.<br />
<br />
- Shield of the Chosen: I've said this in the past, I will say it again. This buff needs pure damage absorption compared to armor. 505 Armor is not going to be noticed by any warrior in game. Make it a % based buff. I recommend it being pure because currently, players are using Shield of the Hero over Shield of the Chosen (excluding Hero being bugged.).<br />
<br />
***Abilities***<br />
<br />
- Aggressive Block: Good change on lowering the energy cost as 35 was too high.Did not like the lowering of block by 10%. I see the mentality is, block more but less times. However right ow we caught the short end of the stick where we block less for less amount.<br />
<br />
- Preservation: You finally fixed this ability to some degree, yet we still can't cast it on ourselves? You made the right call where it heals for 10% of the damage intake and not 10% of max hp. But now a few questions still loom as to why is it on a 15 minute cooldown? Why can't it be casted on ourselves? Why is it so high up on the ability tree when the warrior probably won't even use it unless its on another MT? These questions limit this ability's effectiveness and usefulness to any warrior's arsenal.<br />
<br />
- Impassable Guard: With the increase to block mitigation, this ability gets a bit more valuable. However With it currenly having a 44 point price tag, it is something that is a bit far out of reach for alot of players. I suggest this get switched with preservation, making it a 38 point and Preservation 44 point.<br />
<br />
- Life's Rapture: No comment as I've only used it about once.<br />
<br />
The Paladin received a small amount of changes. Some of them were needed, others were in the sake of balance. However with bugs still around the tree, its hard to gauge the strength of the paladin defensively as agro wise its still as strong as ever.<br />
<br />
***Suggested Changes***<br />
<br />
- Paladin's Reprisal: Lower cooldown to 30-45s. Its damage is nothing crazy and only a 3 second attack. 1 minute cooldown just seems as it does something we haven't seen before. While abilities like the Warlord Lockdown roots for 8 seconds with a 30 second cooldown + damage and agro.<br />
<br />
- Reverent Protection: Damage amount needs to be increased by a HUGE amount, if not then make it a % and last the whole duration. Bottomline to make this ability useful for us as warriors, the damage has to be something worth the points. 1 point for 1 hit absorption is not worth it, especially when its not a complete hit. Make it % based to last 30 seconds and/or increase the number damage amount while lowering the cooldown timer. Or my favorite, just copy the Rift Shield setup for physical damage. I mean they don't stack or anything...<br />
<br />
- Karmic Resolution: Should effect Paladin's Reprisal also.<br />
<br />
- Preservation/Impassable Guard: Switch locations on roots.<br />

un gars qui repond apres ...<br />
<br />
It is really hard to comment on the pally now as the blocking is completely bugged at the moment. I've noticed at least the following:<br />
<br />
- Aggressive block has no (apparent) affect)<br />
- New +20% more dmg blocked has 0 affect<br />
- Shield of the hero seems buggy<br />
- Base block mitigation % lowered significantly<br />
<br />
<br />
Without knowing if some of these are intended or not it is really hard to say much about the new pally.<br />
