<br />
=== KNOWN ISSUES ===<br />
* Granting of the Collector's Edition Satchel has been temporarily disabled.<br />
<br />
<br />
=== FEATURED ===<br />
<br />
<br />
GENERAL GAMEPLAY<br />
* Soul quests can once again be completed! The final objective has also changed to no longer require using an item on the corpse.<br />
* Quest hub Wardstones are now immune to players of the opposite faction.<br />
* Peace of the Grave now lasts 30 seconds and also flags the player as immune to PvP.<br />
* Fixed a bug that could cause interactable objects to become unclickable when they shouldn't be.<br />
<br />
<br />
ASCENDED POWERS<br />
* The Planar Charges meter (small crystals next to your portrait) now has a tooltip, and is only displayed when you have at least one charge.<br />
* Planar Charges are used to activate Ascended Powers. Gain charges by closing Rifts.<br />
* Visit Planar Foci merchants to purchase Ascended Powers.<br />
* Flares for player-summoned invasions are now Ascended Powers instead of consumables.<br />
* There is now a new Ascended power that can be used against Invasions; see Holy Champion for Guardians and Anti-Planar Augmentation for Defiants.<br />
<br />
<br />
RIFTS AND INVASIONS<br />
* Fixed the buff placed on targeted Wardstones during Colossus-spawning zone events. Previously, the Guardian version was being applied to both factions' Wardstones.<br />
* Gathering of Souls: Fixed Grimnir sometimes not spawning at the end of the event.<br />
* The Witching Hour: The boss should now correctly spawn for this zone event.<br />
* The contribution bar now properly tracks when attacking Footholds.<br />
<br />
COMBAT<br />
* When NPCs cast spells, they change their target to the target of the ability for the duration of the cast.<br />
<br />
SOULS<br />
* Renamed all Track (Element) Rift abilities to Track (Element) Creatures.<br />
<br />
PALADIN<br />
* Unyielding Defense: Changed to now mitigate the damage of attacks that are blocked.<br />
<br />
REAVER<br />
* Track Death Creatures: Removed attack point requirement from this ability.<br />
<br />
RIFTBLADE<br />
* Track Earth Creatures: Removed attack point requirement from this ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
DUNGEONS AND RAIDS<br />
* Chat messages now show when someone joins or leaves a raid.<br />
* Fixed the teleport to instance option not showing up a second time if it was not deliberately dismissed and a group member re-entered the instance.<br />
<br />
<br />
ZONES<br />
* No level 50 Death Epic storyline quests should be available yet - they're unhooked for internal testing for now.<br />
<br />
GLOAMWOOD<br />
* Removing the Head: Cleaned up kill target respawn scripting on this quest.<br />
* Blacksap Ancients no longer go into hiding from nearby Footholds.<br />
<br />
PVP/WARFRONTS<br />
* Power-up buffs found in Warfronts now increase Attack Power and Spell Power instead of Damage.<br />
* PvP Servers: Shared quest hubs in Iron Pine, Stillmoor, and Shimmersand are no longer flagged as safe zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
ITEMS<br />
* Updated costs on mid-range Planar Foci. Updated Foci icons.<br />
* Greater Essence rebalancing: Completed a major balance pass on all Greater Essences. The majority of existing Greater Essence items have been removed. Any that were slotted in a Focus are still lingering but will be removed soon.<br />
* All new shiny Greater Essences have been added to the game. Keep an eye out for them!<br />
* Quest: Companion Gift [preorder companion pet selection] can no longer be shared with party members.<br />
* Updated a handful of quests that hadn't had their Planarite rewards scaled up to match the new single-currency progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
CRAFTING<br />
* The Craft All button is now disabled when using a Planar Augmentation while crafting an item. It re-enables if the Planar Augmentation is removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
GRAPHICS AND AUDIO<br />
* The camera now follows the arc of knockbacks so there's less flying off-screen involved.<br />
* Re-fixed face shape customizations not always being applied to your character.<br />
* Rift pieces should despawn properly when closing a Rift while using the low quality renderer.<br />
* General fixes to some visual effects not playing correctly.<br />
<br />
<br />
COMMANDS AND MACROS<br />
* You can now preview items on your character after inspecting another player.<br />
* You can now also link items from the inspection window.<br />
<br />
<br />
UI/SETTINGS<br />
* Cleaned up the bottom of the Collections UI so that books and companion pet listings don't overflow off the bottom of the window.<br />
* Fixed an issue which would cause invalid resolutions set in the config file to crash the client on startup.<br />
* Selecting resolution changes from the settings dropdown should now apply correctly, and not cause the game to claim a 'Custom' resolution.<br />
* Corrected the minimap not revealing explored areas for some video cards.<br />
* Also fixed edges of the main map showing as revealed when they shouldn't have been.<br />
<br />
<br />
CLIENT/SERVER<br />
* Fixed the file shortcut to rift.cfg to point to the correct location.<br />

<div class="message-body">Donc maintenant si tu veux te faire invoquer par une banière, au lieu d'être un item à usage unique, c'est une habilité que tu débloque au marchant.  Excellent. :)</div>
