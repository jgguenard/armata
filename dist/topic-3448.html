Phase 1 (Wolf) -<br />
This phase was a basic encounter, similar to other boss' where taunt rotations are required, adds spawning, and some nice AoE damage. Off the pull, the AoE damage shocked me and the other cleric, expecting 10% health drops every 5/6 seconds, it was dropping us to around 50% every tick. Although this was pretty hard to deal with on the first few tries, with having to spam heal the single tank, we ended up working out a rotation to out heal the AoE damage, with that sorted, we was expecting a free kill. Note: At this point, we only had one tank, and 9 players in total. We then realised the adds spawned, and the heal reduce effect on the tank so we looked in General (Level 1-9) and found a pug tank who happily came along for the fun of it. After a few wipes, we ended up downing this fight, tanks rotating, adds aggro rotating, lots of AoE healing and a lot of focus. All in all, it was a pretty enjoyable encounter, especially considering the gear level of the members we had!<br />
<br />
Phase 2 (Spiders) -<br />
This phase was pretty challenging, we was expecting the three spiders, slight AoE damage, massive tank damage, and lots of dps required to do this phase. We ended up pulling all three spiders at once (not knowing what would happen), 3 chain knockbacks, the raid was dead. (Blame the healers). We spent about 5 minutes discussing our next move and we tried pulling them singular, it worked, but two came the first time, the adds spawned (200k hp?!?) and then double knockbacks was too much for the two healers, so we wiped and tried again with a different tactic. This time, our tank grabbed one spider (aggroing two), ran away so one of them reset, and we took the one spider on it's own. The adds were picked up by the other tank (just held throughout the fight) and single knockbacks were healable. We downed the spider and then repeated it with the two others. Was a pretty fun &amp; challenging phase.The only thing which confused us, which I believe leads onto a bug, is that when you kill the third spider (ending the phase), the adds it spawns don't dissapear instantly, they stick around for about 20 seconds. Now, I don't know if this is the sole reason, but this causes the Third Phase to start, and then instantly finish, the boss turns into the turtle-like thing, and then she just runs back &quot;Stage Complete!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Phase 3 (Turtle) -<br />
When you kill the third spider (ending the phase), the adds it spawns don't dissapear instantly, they stick around for about 20 seconds. Now, I don't know if this is the sole reason, but this causes the Third Phase to start, and then instantly finish, the boss turns into the turtle-like thing, and then she just runs back &quot;Stage Complete!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Phase 4 (Treant) -<br />
This phase was by far the most confusing thing we'd ever encountered. The tree appears in the middle, and has idols which channel a shield on her. The idols are defended by 180k hp treants and when all idols are down, the boss becomes active (I assume). We tried pulling them at once, and nuking down the tree's, but then about 8 more treants (with 19k hp) appeared, and start attacking, didn't think this was how it should work. We tried again but only attempting to pull one treant, nuke it down, nuke the idol. All seemed doable, until when we pulled the first one, three of them charged us, mass damage to the tank, and spawning another set of adds which seemed to wipe the raid. At this point, our pugged tank went link dead and din't come back until the timer ended, so we failed that phase Q_Q. We ended up leaving confused at this point, put will hopefully return to the raid rift when more of the guild hit level 50 and gear up.<br />
<br />
Please Note:<br />
The Reborn members were not levelled to 50 and geared to 50, each of us levelled through questing, geared through dungeons, and did expert groups to gear ourselves up, we're in epic/blue gear and don't have enough 50's to change composition as easy as some other guilds can.<br />
