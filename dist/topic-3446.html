The next patch is going to have a major Apothecary update. Here is a list of all of the changes you can expect to see in the upcoming patch. Please let us know what you think and if anything isn't functioning once these reach Alpha. We're hoping that these changes will take the Apothecary up a few notches in usefulness and variety.<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Changes<br />
Â•Several ranks of Mana Potions, Healing Potions, Healing Tonics, and Mana Tonics have been removed.<br />
Â•All other potions have been either removed or replaced by revised versions or new types of potions.<br />
Â•Flasks have been replaced by Vials.<br />
Â•New potions include Serums, new Philters, Brews, Elixirs, Bottles, Warding Potions, Concoctions, etc.<br />
Â•All potions have had their power and level requirements adjusted. There are now less ranks of potions covering wider ranges of power and with more lenient use level requirements.<br />
<br />
Recipe Changes<br />
<br />
Â•If you were an Apothecary your recipe list has been updated. Old recipes have been removed and wherever applicable should be replaced by a new recipe. Any old recipes in your recipe list were replaced with new recipes that are available from the Apothecary trainer. If you had drop/faction/artisan recipes previously, they have been lost.<br />
Â•In some cases this may result in a red recipe in your recipe list.<br />
<br />
Quest Changes<br />
<br />
Â•All Apothecary Daily quests have been updated to require the new crafted items.<br />
Â•In some cases certain daily quests have had their min requirement lowered by 10 points.<br />
<br />
Non-Trainer Recipes<br />
<br />
Â•All notoriety vendors have been updated to sell new recipe scrolls. These include items such as Fireworks, Polymorph potions, Growth potions, and other unique items.<br />
Â•Apothecary Artisan store has been updated to sell the new recipe scrolls. The Artisan store now offers a wider variety of Rare and Epic potions and vials.<br />
Â•Planar Faction vendors in Meridian and Sanctum now offer new recipe scrolls for sale. These merchants offer planar Warding Potions and Resistance Vials.<br />
<br />
Resources<br />
<br />
Â•There is now a new water based planed called Krakenweed which can be found in Scarlet Gorge, Stonefield, Freemarch, and Gloamwood. This plant is used in the item &quot;Fisherman's Brew&quot;, which will be available in an upcoming patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the exception of certain ranks of Healing and Mana Potions, all old crafted Apothecary items are still available in game. They will be deleted in the upcoming patch.<br />
